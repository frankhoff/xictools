This directory contains the Verilog source files from the test suite for
ivl (source file: ivl_tests-20010630.tgz).  Ivl is another Verilog simulator
project, see http://icarus.com.  The test suite is available from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/ivtest

The ivltests directory contains tons of useful test files.  A very few
have been modified (use "grep SRW *.v") to fix possible bugs and/or
add comments.  The run script will run these tests.  The run.out file
contains sample output from the run script. NOTE: both stdout and stderr
are directed into run.out.

NOTE:  About a dozen of the files under ivltest have a GNU license
copyright header, which reference the COPYING file in this directory. 
The COPYING file has no significance to files not so marked. 
Commmercial users may wish to delete these files.

The contrib directory contains a few more verilog files.  The add32.v
file seems to have fundamental errors and won't run under vl.
