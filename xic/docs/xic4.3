Xic Generation 4 Release Notes

This is the 4.3 post-production series.  See the release note archive
for the production releases (4.2.1 - 4.2.16) and earlier.

The 4.3 branch is the first open-source release of the XicTools.  The
programs (Xic, WRspice, and others) are available at no cost, in
binary packages for selected operating systems, and as source code.

As open-source, there may well be many different versions of the
programs available.  As much as possible, these will be consolidated
into general releases, and tagged known-good releases will be issued
periodically.  The latest source code will be available directly from
the repository, for those wishing to track the latest.

Scroll down to the notes for the current Xic release, which follows
some important general information.

*****************************************************
IMPORTANT -- New Windows framework, releases.

Starting January 2021, all Windows binaries are 64-bit, compiled under
the MINGW64 subsystem of MSYS2 (64-bit version).

Although it may be possible to run the programs from other MINGW64
installations, for example Cygwin, it is recommended MSYS2 be
installed.  This replaces the "gtk_bundle" package that was previously
used to supply gui dlls.

* Installing MSYS2

MSYS2 is a linux-like environment similar to Cygwin.

When installing MSYS2 and XicTools programs, you are strongly
advised to install in the default locations.

Go to msys2.org.  Download and run the installer, and follow the
directions.  It is easy.  When done, you will have a shell window on
the screen.  You should type the following commands to load some
things you'll need.

 pacman -S vim
 pacman -S winpty
 pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk2
 pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gsl

Then, use the vim editor to edit the .bash_profile file that exists in
the current (your home) directory.  Add the following lines to the
bottom of the file:

 mount c:/usr/local/xictools /usr/local/xictools
 export PATH="/usr/local/xictools/bin:$PATH"

* The mintty Terminal Emulator Window

The terminal window used in MSYS2 is "mintty".  This does NOT work
directly with native Windows programs that work with a console window,
which includes the XicTools programs.  One must run WRspice and
probably Xic with the "winpty" program.  Just type "winpty" followed
by the name and arguments of the program you want to run.

For example, command to run WRspice is

 winpty wrspice ...

where the ... represents the command line arguments to wrspice.

The winpty program performs some magic that enables native Windows
programs expecting to find a cmd.com type of window to work with
the mintty.

*****************************************************
IMPORTANT -- Mac OS X note!

The Darwin64 package release is now generated on High Sierra (10.13),
but the programs are fully compatible with Sierra (10.12), Mojave
(10.14), and Catalina (10.15).

*****************************************************
IMPORTANT -- Font Size (March 2020)

The default GTK font sizes generally seem reasonable on Linux and
Windows, but not on Apple, where they are too small on my old 2010 13
inch MacBook Pro, and too large on my new 15 inch MacBook Pro.

One can change the fonts with the Font setting pop up and saving, but
these apply only to text in application windows, not the native widget
text.  The widget text size could be changed in the .gtkrc-2.0 file.

Now, the default application font sizes track the widget font sizes,
so fixing font sizes can generally be done very simply from .gtkrc-2.0
as below.

1.  Create (if necessary, it might already exist) a file in your home
directory named ".gtkrc-2.0".

2.  Add a line to the file, for example:  gtk-font-name="foo 10"

The integer 10 is an example, your size may vary.  Experiment to find
the best size for your screen.  For my old MacBook I use 18, for the
new one 10.  Linux and Windows seem to get this right in the first
place, 10 being about the default.

*****************************************************
IMPORTANT -- Search path setup.

In 4.3 releases, all executables are linked into the
   /usr/local/xictools/bin
directory, or the equivalent if you installed xictoiols in another
location.  The directory should be added to your shell search path.

*****************************************************
End of general info.

xic-4.3.11  01/20/2021
Current Release

CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES
------- --- --- --------

* New layer extraction keyword:  ViaCut layer_expr

  This is applied to a physical layer (has Thickness > 0) that opens
  up cuts from the layer expression.  This applies only when using 3D
  processing such as for cross sections and the FastCap/FastHenry
  interface.  It allows one to separate abstract Via layers from the
  physical layers that represent dielectrics.  The abstract layers are
  used for LVS, DRC, etc.  The patterning is applied to the dielectric
  ViaCut layers when computing 3D geometry.  This allows abstract vias
  to have cuts through multiple dielectric layers.

  ViaCut layers are assumed planarizing (like Via layers).

  There is a new script function IsLayerViaCut().

  ViaCut was added to the Layer keyword editor,

  Example:  You have the following sequence of layers:
  M1 I1A R1 I1B M2 VM12 VR12
  The I1A and I1B layers are dielectrics, which encapsulate a
  resistor R1.  VM12 is a via between M1 and M2, VR12 is a via
  between R1 and M2 (these are two separate etch steps).

  To express the dielectrics and via connectivity for this structure,
  one can use

  PhysLayer I1A
  ViaCut VM12
  Thickness 0.2

  PhysLayer i1B
  ViaCut VM12|VR12
  Thickness 0.2

  PhysLayer VM12
  Via M1 M2

  PhysLayer VR12
  Via R1 M2

  In this case, the VM12 and VR12 layers have no thickness, so they
  become symbolic, but still establish connectivity for netlisting
  and LVS.  The physical structure in 3D is actually established
  by the I1A and I1B layers, which must have nonzero Thickness.  These
  are used when 3D extraction (cross section of L/C extraction) is
  being performed.
    
* New physical tech parameter Tau.

  This is the Drude relaxation time for resistive layers, as accepted
  by current releases of FastHenry.  This enables extraction of the
  parasitic inductance of resistors, which can become appreciable for
  some materials at low temperature.

  There is a new script function GetLayerTau()

  Tau was added to the layer keyword editor.
  This is exported to FastHenry.

* Major update to FastHenry interface.

  New veriables: FhDefNhinc, FhDefRh, FhOverride, FhUseFilament,
      FhVolEnablle, FhVolElMin.

  These have corresponding new entries in the Params page of the LR
  Extraction panel.

  These provide better control/use of non-monotonic thickness division
  similar to nhinc but internal,


BUGS FIXED
---- -----

* Misc. small fixes.


===============================================================================
xic-4.3.10  07/20/2020
Current Release

CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES
------- --- --- --------

* Updates to the FastHenry interface.

    1. New technology file physical layer keywords: FH_nhinc, FH_rh.
    These correspond to the FastHenry nhinc and rh segment options
    (number of filaments and filament width ratio).  When given and
    non-default, these will be added to each segment definition for
    the layer that is parallel to the substrate and has the height of
    the film thickness, in generated FastHenry input files.

    2) New variable FhDefaults and corresponding entry area in the LR
    Extraction panel (from the Extract menu).  Any text in this entry
    is added to the generated FastHenry input file in a ".DEFAULT"
    line.

* Default Technology Files

    Added a technology file for the SeeQC 4-superconducting layer
    process (c4S1).  This is a continuation under new management of
    the Hypres process.

    SeeQC Inc., Elmsford, NY USA  https://www.seeqc.com
    https://seeqc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SeeqcDesignRules_S1.pdf

    The Hypres tech file will remain for now, for historical
    compatibility, but that process no longer exists - use the SeeQC
    tech file for new work.

* New Predefined Macros

    New predefined macros are TECHNOLOGY, VENDOR, and PROCESS, all
    upper-case, and added Process and Vendor techfile keywords,
    analogous to Technology.  The macros are set in the technology
    file, e.g.

        Technology      sce
        Vendor          SeeQC
        Process         c4s1

    These expand like other macros., and can be queried when macro
    expanding lines from startup files.  In device.lib, for example,

         If vendor = IBM
         ...
         Endif.

    The TECHNOLOGY value is also set as a Define, as if (from the
    example)

        Define sce

    was given.

* Misc. Properties and Terminals

    For R, L, C devices, it is now possible to apply both a model and
    value properties.  Both properties are used when netlisting.

    One can now set/modify vectored instance range by editing the
    label.  If the given name string contains a range suffix <n:m>, it
    will be used to set the range property.  Lack of a suffix will
    delete an existing range.  It seems that the only way to revert to
    internally generated labels is to delete the name property in the
    Properties Editor.

    The "byname" terminals are now forced to have the same locations
    as bus terminals that they implelent bits of.  This is for
    consistency, and for the Node Mapping panel marks.


* Repetition is now added to gpulse source instances read from from
  OpenAccess.

* Fixed a SPICE netlisting bug.

* Fixed a weird display problem on OpenSuse.  Before, if the mouse
  enters the Xic tray icon, the display will be munged if the pointer
  is in the main drawing window when redrawing.  Dragging the mouse
  over one of the other icons would fix things.

* Updated the SPICE output line sorting to better represent arrayed
  instance names.

* Fixed bug:  press/hold button 3 in drawing window, move pointer out of
  Xic and release, get a segmentation fault.

* Fixed an issue under Ubuntu with the default theme.  The Print Control
  panel was black and basically unusable.

* Fixed some problems with netlisting of arrayed instances and bundle
  terminals.  Most importantly, terminal devices with non-scalar net
  expression labels didn't work.

* Fixed bad syntax in SPICE output .saves from vector subcells.

* Suppress display of invisible terminals in ghost move display of
  schematic instances.

* Fixed bug, moved instance bus terminal positions were not updated.

* Fixed an ugly one.  When a cell was saved as native, the bounding box
  would become incorrect, and physical cells would appear empty if there
  are no subcells.

* Fixed bug, couldn't revert from assigned name of instance.

* When editing a range property from the Properties panel, any existing
  text is now displayed in the prompt line.

* Fixed connectivity bug in arrayed bus terms.

* Probable bug fix, when WRspice doesn't converge, sometimes Xic
  freezes.  Added code to (tentatively) avoid this problem.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
xic-4.3.9  11/20/2019
Current Release

CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES
------- --- --- --------

* Improved FastHenry interface.

    FastHenry:  XicTools update to the 090919 package, release number 14.
    The default solver is now KLU, which can be much faster.

    Updates to the FastHenry interface for faster/better operation,
    particularly with non-Manhattan features.  Manhattanizing is now
    done before any cutting.

    The FhMinRect variable no longer exists, non-Manhattan refinement
    is handled by FhManhGridCnt.

    New variable: FhManhGridCnt
    The minimum size used to approximate non-Manhattan is sqrt((area
    of interest)/FhManhGridCnt).  Larger is more accurate but slower,
    similar to FhVolElTarget.  The range is 1e2-1e5, the default is
    1e3.  An entry area in the Params page of the FastHenry interface
    panel sets and is set by this variable.

    During refinement for the FastHenry interface (Volume Element
    Refinement is checked on the Params page of the panel), volume
    element size is computed with a new algorithm which provides a
    better value.

* Improved portable-PCell (Synopsys/Ciranova) grip support.

    Xic now handles all Ciranova location codes.  The locations that
    are not centered on a Manhattan edge are displayed as glyph grips
    (others remain as lines).  45 degree rotations work now.

* Miscellaneous

    Environment variables are now recognized and expanded when
    handling most file paths.  In particular, these are used when
    generating .include/.lib lines when generating SPICE output.

    New environment variable XIC_TECH_DIR.
    The value is a path to a directory.  If given, the directory is
    searched for the technology file, if not found in the current
    directory, and before other locations.


BUGS FIXED
---- -----

* The macro functionality (opamp example) was broken, an internal
  macro flag was not getting set when reading a disk file.

* The OppenAccess plug-in can now build under OA release major 5.
    
* Errors in ReadCdsLmap were reported as from ReadCdsTech.

* The is_library OpenAccess interface function was succeeding only for
  libraries defined in the top-level lib.defs file.  The search now
  recurses to full depth.  This prevented the Place button operation
  from Content windows from the OA Libraries pop-up from working
  except for libraries defined at the top level.

* Avoid spurious warning about changing group count in the FastHenry
  interface.

* Fixed a crash in the Compare Layouts function in the Convert menu.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
xic-4.3.8  8/5/2019
Current Release

CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES
------- --- --- --------

* Internal code refactoring for better maintainability.

* Internal code changes to avoid compiler warnings and faults from
  new compilers.

* OpenAccess Support

    The OA TCL pcell example now works in Xic.  One can place,
    remaster, etc.  Added a debug print of the PCell evaluator name.

* Misc. Changes

    Now just append ".cir" to the cell name to create the default
    SPICE dump file name.  Previously anything after a final '.' was
    stripped before appending "cir".

    When entering an analysis string for the run and deck buttons,
    leading periods are now ignored, e.g. ".tran" and "tran" are
    equivalent.


BUGS FIXED
---- -----

* Fixed a bug that prevented the Place button operation from Content
  windows from the OA Libraries pop-up from working except for
  libraries defined in the top level lib.defs file.

* Fixed:  for RPM distributions, wr_install needed to be run twice to
  properly update an existing installation.

* Note regarding Debian and warnings about missing Adwaita theme.  User
  can add this theme:

  sudo apt install gnome-themes-extra

* Eliminated a spurious OA message that appeared sometimes when saving
  native cells.

* Changes to the OpenAccess interface to avoid cell name clashes with
  Xic device library names.  Many cells in the analogLib couldn't be
  opened or placed from the Contents Listing, "oa_" is now prepended
  to the OA cell name to avoid clashes.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
xic-4.3.7  3/11/2019
Current Release

CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES
------- --- --- --------

* Updates to the OpenAccess plug-in.

  Lots of work on the OpenAccess support.

  The OpenAccess TCL pcell example now works in Xic.  One can place,
  remaster, etc.  TCL can therefor provide a portable pcell language. 
  So why is there a need for Python portable pcells, as championed by
  Ciranova/Synopsys?  Maybe the need to be fluent in both OA and TCL
  is too much of a barrier.

  The "tweaking" applied to devices from the analogLib has changed. 
  Previously, all cells from analogLib were given a "alib_" prefix in
  Xic to avoid name clashes.  this is no longer done.  Instead, there
  is an internal list of cell names, mostly from analogLib and Basic
  (these libraries are supplied with Virtuoso and Synopsys Custom
  Compiler).  If an OA cell name is found in this list (from any
  library), "oa_" is prepended to the corresponding cell name in Xic.

  If a device instance has an instance name prefixed by the name
  prefix (either the CDF entry or an instNamePrefix property), the
  instance is given this as an assigned name.

* Miscellaneous Changes

  New variable:  SpiceInclude  (string)

  This can be set to a file path.  When a SPICE netlist is created
  with this variable set, text will be added to the top of the SPICE
  deck.  If the file is found, the text from the file is added to the
  deck verbatim.  Othewise, ".include path" is added, the path being
  the file path from the variable.  This applies when ceating SPICE
  with the deck button, or when preparing input for the simulator when
  using the run button.

  Updated the rsfq_lib.tar.gz file in the examples.  Cleaned out .bak
  cells and added a pdf of the 2013 JJ Workshop talk that addresses
  inductorless RSFQ.


BUGS FIXED
---- -----

* When entering an analysis string for the run and deck buttons,
  leading periods are now stripped, ensuring that only one period is
  used in the SPICE output.

* Just append ".cir" to the cell name to create the SPICE input file
  name, previously anything after the final '.' was stripped before
  appending ".cir".

* Many bugs were fixed in the OpenAccess support and plug-in.

* Renamed a function to avoid name a clash with virtual function
  (different args so safe) reported (only) by Clang in OS X Mojave.

* Fixed a strange Ubuntu-18 problem where a button widget name
  apparently clashed with the theme and it inherited a black
  background.  Changed name SelPanel to SelCP to fix.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
xic-4.3.6  8/14/2018

CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES
------- --- --- --------

* Schematic property changes.

  The Name property, used for cells and cell instances, has changed.
  This is internal and leads to better efficiency.

  The Macro property has disappeared, and has been replaced by a flag
  in the Name property.

  The property usage model for Name/Macro properties has changed, and
  there is a backwards compatibility issue.

    > Xic 4.3.6 can read and correctly process any Xic file.

    > Files written by 4.3.6 contain no Macro properties, unless the
      WriteMacroProps variable is set, in which case any needed Macro
      properties will be regenerated when writing output.  This must
      be set for files written with xic-4.3.6 to be read properly by
      earlier Xic releases, if Macro properties would be present.

      However, Macro properties are unusual, and these are set
      primarily by the OpenAccess reader when encountering certain
      passive device schematic symbols that are implemented as macros
      instead of models.  Unless you have created these yourself, or
      are using OpenAccess with a PDK, you won't have to worry about
      Macro properties.

      When Xic-4.3.6 encounters a Macro property when reading input, a
      window pops up warning the user to set the WriteMacroProps
      variable before writing output to be exported to pre-4.3.6
      systems.  If this doesn't appear, then the design is "safe".

      The message will not appear if the WriteMacroProps variable is
      set, which can be done in a .xicstart/.xicinit or techfile.  If
      you are using 4.3.6 only, just save the design to produce files
      without Macro properties, and thus avoid the pop-up.

  Specific changes.
  1.  New separate propery structures for cells/instances, instance name
      derives from cell name.

  2.  In Name property string, there is a new "macro" keyword which
      sets the macro flag.  Ths logic is about the same as before,
      with "macro" being the complement of the previous "subckt" flag,
      for elements keyed with X.

  3.  The macro flag can be set for devices as well as subcircuits. 
      For devices, this replaces the separate Macro property.  Old
      files with macro properties read fine, the macro properties set
      the flag and are removed.  They can be regenerated in output if
      the new WriteMacroProps variable is set.  This is required for
      backward compatibility to 4.3.5 and earlier when Macro properties
      would be present.

  4.  The macro flag in instances is inherited from the master and is
      not settable from the instance name property string.

  5.  The property string syntax has changed a bit, but is backwards
      compatible except for macro properties.

      Master:
        if macro flag is set:           <prefix> macro
        else if <prefix) is "X":        X 0 subckt
        else:                           <prefix>
        The "X 0 subckt" is for backward compatibility, just "X" would
        be sufficient for 4.3.6 and later.
        Also for backward compatibility, the reader takes "X anything"
        (two tokens) as "X macro".

      Instance:
        any case:                       <name> number [subckt [<x> <y>]]
        The "subckt" appears if <name> starts with "X" and macro is
        not set in the master.  Coordinates additionally appear if a
        physical label was placed (in extraction).  The "subckt" and
        coordinates are ignored by the reader, but can be seen in native
        cell files (for example).

  6.  If a macro property is read, an Info window appears telling the
      user to set WriteMacroProps if backwards compatibility is
      needed.
     
* OpenAccess interface enhancements

    Update to OpenAccess translator property handling.  All electrical
    cell properties are now read at once, from both schematic and
    symbol views, before reading other content.  This ensures having
    all values available when needed, which avoids some trouble.

    A new property XICP_PARTNAME (7162) can be applied, and is set
    from "partName" properties when reading OpenAccess.  This is used
    in in @partName text labels.

* Misc. Changes

  If a file named ".xic_ignore" exists in a "models" directory, the
  directory content will be ignored.

  A -d option was added to the !mklib command for creating references
  to directories that contain collections of native cell files.

* New !preload command and RegisterSubMaster function.

  These allow native sub-master cells in the library to resolve
  references when reading OpenAccess data, useful when pcell
  evaluation is not possible.  Rather obscure, see the help system
  (give "? RegisterSubMasters") for complete information.


BUGS FIXED
---- -----

* Fixed a bug causing some temporary files to not be deleted on normal
  program exit.

* Prevent the simulation monitor pop-up from taking focus, to avoid
  giving focus back to the main window which causes iplots to
  disappear underneath the Xic window (on some window managers).

* The extraction system will now ignore duplicate instance placements,
  these are ignored elsewhere as well.  Previously these caused errors
  and required explicit removal before extraction would work.

* Fixed a bug causing errors if the Place button was used with library
  cells.

* Using Place from the Contents pop-up from the OpenAccess Libraries
  listing panel requred that the library be open, or there was an
  error with an uninformative message.  The library is no longer
  required to be open for placement through this button.

* Fixed ghost terminal marks incorectly appearing in the main window
  when copying from a schematic sub-window with a different cell, and
  the mouse pointer is in the sub-window.

* Avoid showing the Merge Control pop-up spuriously when loading pcell
  sub-masters.

* Fixed miscellaneous bugs in pcell evaluation.

* Highlighted bus terminals were not being erased when deleted.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
xic-4.3.5  4/19/2018

CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES
------- --- --- --------

* Technology file search.

  The technology file will now be found if installed in a subdirectory
  named "techfiles" in the directory where Xic is started.  The search
  order is the current directory, techfiles subdirectory, the library
  path.

* The software updating through the mozy help browser should work now.
  The special url is ":xt_pkgs".


BUGS FIXED
---- -----

* In Windows, the interprocess communication to WRspice was broken in
  the default installation.

  The installation format change and other things prevented the setup
  from working "out of the box".  Basically, the internal default path
  to WRspice could not be found.  One would have to set up the path
  manually, using the SpiceProg variable.  Also, the batch file can
  not be used here, one must link the .exe file, which is no longer
  exported to .../xictools/bin, but can be found in the link
  .../xictools/wrspice/bin.  Anyway, the default setup should be ok
  now.

  Also, the installation script used "junction" links for the
  executables linked into .../xictools/bin.  These can't be run from
  cmd.exe (a "DOS box") for some reason known only to Microsoft. 
  These have been changed to normal symbolic links which seem to work
  now in the current Windows 10.  The junction links work fine in a
  Cygwin window.

* Fixed a minor bug in the FastCap/FastHenry interface:  if the
  program was run in the foreground, the "Running jobs" displayed in
  the panel would be incremented but not decremented when the run
  finishes.

* Fixed a problem in the "Node Mapping" panel from the side menu.  In
  click-to-select mode in a physical mode subwindow, with the "Use
  Extract" check box not checked, the wrong node was being selected.

* Xic was not recognizing the new xictools-included fastcap and
  fasthenry as being the "wr" versions.

* Fixed crash due to dark-field ground-plane when grouping.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
xic-4.3.4  2/23/2018

CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES
------- --- --- --------

* Flattening functionality update.

  Three new boolean variables:

    NoFlattenStdVias
      When set, standard via instances will not be flattened, but are
      retained as standard vias at the top of the flattened hierarchy.

    NoFlattenPCells
      When set, parameterized cell (pcell) instances will not be
      flattened, but are retained as pcells at the top of the
      flattened hierarchy.

  The NoFlattenStdVias and NoFlattenPCells modes apply only when
  flattening without windowing.  When flattening cell data from a
  file, these apply only when the sub-masters are not included in the
  file (i.e., the sub-masters are created in Xic).  When true,
  instance placements are retained but moved to the top of the
  flattened hierarchy.

    NoFlattenLabels
      When set, labels in subcells are ignored when flattening.  This
      prevents creating wire nets with conflicting net labels.

  These variables have corresponding check boxes in these four panels:
    1. Flatten Hierarchy, from the Flatten button in the Edit menu.
    2. Export Control, from the Export Cell Data button in the Convert
       menu.
    3. Import Control, from the Import Cell Data button in the Convert
       menu.
    4. Format Conversion, from the Format Conversion button in the
       Convert menu.

* I/O update (Convert menu functions).

  The Import Control panel now has a windowing/flattening control
  group in the Read File page allowing these operations to be
  performed as input is being read (physical data only).

  The Export Control and Format Conversion panels are now paged,
  with a Setup page that provides options, and a second page from
  where the operation is started.

  The Import Control, Export Control, and Format Conversion operations
  now work more correctly with library, standard vias, and pcells.
  By default, masters of these cells are never written to output unless
  this is explicitly enabled (by check boxes in the Setup pages or
  variables).  If written, while scaling, these masters will never be
  scaled.  Instead, all of their instance placements are scaled.

  The WriteAllCells variable has been renamed to "KeepLibMasters"
  which better describes its effect.  WriteAllCells still works as an
  alias for now but is undocumented.

  The Format Conversion panel now has check boxes "Include library
  cell masters", "Include parameterized cell sub-masters" and "Include
  standard via cell sub-masters" which track the variables KeepLibMasters,
  KeepPCellSubMastgers, and KeepStdViaSubMasters.  These are also found
  in the Export Control panel.  These determine whether library cells,
  pcells, and standard via cells are written to output.

* Update to !netext command.

  If neither of -w or -g is given, or "-w 0,0,0,0", or "-g 0", then
  the effective area is the entire bounding box of the top-level cell.

  In this case, there is an additional "-vs" argument recognized. 
  When given, standard vias will not be flattened but remain as
  instances in the net cells.  This applies when via sub-masters are
  not included is the source file, and are thus created internally in
  Xic.

  If the net has a name, a generated net file will be given a cell
  property with number 7149 and the string being the net name.  Beware
  if using a grid:  if flattening, the top net cell will contain the
  net name properties from all grid cells, so there may be duplicate
  or inconsistent name properties.  If not flattening, the primary and
  all subcells should be checked, each property applies only to the
  corresponding grid location.  In either case, conflicting names need
  to be dealt with somehow.


BUGS FIXED
---- -----

* Updated special-purpose code that helps associate physical and
  schematic MOS circuits.  The previous test required that power and
  ground nets be defined as global.  If not so defined, some device
  associations wouldn't be found.  The new code doesn't require this,
  and provides complete association in these cases.

* The files xic.exe and wrspice.exe triggered a virus alert in the
  Webroot virus scanner.  This is spurious, but prevented the programs
  from being installed.  I found that by not stripping these exe
  files, the alert wasn't triggered.  The Makefiles were modified to
  not strip xic.exe and wrspice.exe for this reason.

* Fixed up the Apple gtk2-bundle-x11 build, which needed some tweaks
  to the library list for the current MacPorts.  The wr_install script
  now installs this without complaining that it isn't an xictools-4.3
  distribution.

* The Selection Contol panel object type filtering was not working.

* Conversion function scaling bugs fixed.  The operations from the
  Import Control, Export Control, and Format conversion panels did
  not play nicely with scaling and library, parameterixed, and
  standard via cells.  Much effort went to cleaning this up.

* The main cell database was updated to fix a logic problem that would
  cause trouble if there were large numbers of duplicate objects. 
  This was discovered when a coding error was producing dozens of
  redundant standard via cells at each location.  Removing the
  duplicates with the duplicate object filter would cause crashes, and
  other odd behavior was seen.  Presently, the database should be
  immune to this, which is unlikely in real layouts, but one never
  knows.

xic-4.3.3  1/10/2018

CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES
------- --- --- --------

* New system to generate and track instance names in physical mode. 

  Each physical cell instance has a name consisting of the master
  name, colon separator, and a 0-based index number in database order
  (top to bottom then left to right of the upper left corner of the
  instance bounding box).  The index number is increased by the size
  of the array when numbering array instances, to leave space for
  indexing individual components.

  The instance name is used in the Select/Choose Instances panel (see
  below), in the label of unexpanded physical instances shown in the
  drawing windows, and in the extraction system.  Instance numbers are
  regenerated when needed, after a modification which changes the
  instance list of a cell.  They are stable and reproducible as long
  as the containing cell and its hierarchy are unmodified.

  New boolean variable: NoInstnameLabels

  When set, unexpanded physical instances in drawing windows will use
  the master name (as in previous Xic releases) rather than instance
  names introduced in this release.

* Selection system change.

  A new pop-up applies when there are three or more cell instances
  potentially in a selection operation (point or area) and no
  selectable geometry.  The Select Instances panel produces a list of
  instances with a clickable yes/no to toggle selected status of each
  listed instance.  When the selection mechanism is used to choose
  instances for some other purpose, the same pop-up, laabelled "Choose
  Instances" appears.  The pop-up is modal in either case, meaning all
  but the pop-up is locked out while the pop-up is visible.

  This was implemented to allow selection of instances when there are
  many overlapping subcells, such as a netext file where each wire net
  is a separate subcell.

* Script functions changed.

  GetInstanceName       Support for physical cell instance names added.
  GetInstanceIdNum()    Now returns the physical instance number as used
                        in the instance name, checks for sequence validity.
  GetInstanceAltId()    Checks for number sequence validity.


BUGS FIXED
---- -----

* Fixed segmentation fault library access code.

* Library references weren't being followed through a Cell Hierarchy
  Digest (CHD), e.g., expanded library cells were blank in display mode.

* The Info command was leaving pointers to freed memory in the
  selection list, resulting in potential instability.

* Script parser:  parse of string constants was not expanding
  backslash escapes correctly, a\\b would be read as a\<backspace>
  instead of a\b.

* The Logo script function was incorectly ignoring the LogoPixelSize
  variable.

* In logo creation, there is no longer caching of the width/height of
  xpm data.  This caused trouble when the user reuses the same xpm
  file name but changes the content.

* In the Xiv feature set, pressing Esc twice now deselects all, the
  same as in Xic.

xic-4.3.2  10/29/2017

CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES
------- --- --- --------

* New package management system

  The existing system which automatically checks for updated packages
  has been removed, and a new package management system is available. 
  The system for sending messages to users through the wrcad.com web
  site, which was never used, has also been removed.  Presently, there
  is no internet access attempted on program startup, which saves
  time.

  The new package management page is build into the help system, so is
  available in Xic, WRspice, and in the stand-alone mozy help browser. 
  Giving the keyword/url

    :xt_pkgs

  displays a page showing the installed and available xictools
  packages.  Available packages can be downloaded and installed
  through this interface.  This can also be accessed with the
  !update command.

  The following items have been removed from Xic and the
  documentation:
    XT_NO_CHECK_UPDATE  environment variable
    XT_UPD_DEBUG        environment variable
    NoCheckUpdate       variable
    InstallCmdFormat    variable
    !passwd             command
    !proxy              command

  The proxy functionality has also been moved the the help system,
  through a new Set Proxy button in the Options menu of the help
  windows.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
xic-4.3.1  10/1/2017

Welcome the the first open-source release of Xic.  Now, instead of
asking Whiteley Research for new features, users can modify the source
code and do it themselves.  Please contribute!  We can help.

Changes are relative to the final production release xic-4.2.16.


CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES
------- --- --- --------

* Major refactoring due to lack of C++ standards conformance
  throughout the program, which caused real trouble with the latest
  C++ compilers.

  Specifically, it used to be possible to write very efficient
  linked-list code in C++ making use of the assumption that it is
  possible to call a method from a non-polymorphic class through a
  null pointer, and check for a null "this" pointer in the function
  body.  One could iterate over the list headed by "this" and have
  correct behavior when the list is empty.  This idiom was not
  uncommon, though it violated the official dictum that calling a
  method from a null object leads to undefined behavior.  The idiom
  was used in the Microsoft Foundation Class, for example.  Surely,
  the elegance and efficiency would obviously lead to de-facto
  standardization, right?  Alas, such code generates a warning in
  Apple's latest clang, and in addition segmentation faults in gcc-7.1
  under Fedora 26.  This code had to be replaced by static functions
  that explicitly pass an object pointer.  Uglier, more complex code,
  but it works.  This is an unfortunate step backward for "a better C
  than C" aspect of C++.

* Major effort to clean up core leaks and other internal consistency
  issues using the Valgrind analysis tool.  Lots of small things were
  fixed as a result.

* Miscellaneous changes required in port to Fedora 26, mostly in
  interprocess communication code.

* Reversed direction of Ctrl-mouse wheel zoom, to match prevailing
  standard.

* The Grid panel was changed visually to avoid some cosmetic problems
  with the default Fedora/Gnome theme.

* The Color Selection panel was updated to allow setting opposite-mode
  (electrical when in physical mode and vice-versa) colors.

* New environment variable XT_GUI_COMPRESS.  When set, don't allow
  space around button contents.  Such space can cause side menu button
  images to be truncated on low-res displays.  Specifically, this fixes
  Xic displayed in a VirtualBox running Fedora.

* The !dumpcds command will now output a GDSII layer mapping file in
  addition to the Cadence ASCII tech and drf files.

* New Join features for wires.

  The !join command can now join wires in electrical mode.

  New command:  !jw [-l]
  Without argument, take the latest selected wire, and join it
  recursively to other existing similar wires that share an endpoint.
  With -l (letter l), join if possible all wires on the current layer.

* !select layer syntax tweak.

  1.  A hyphen ('-') is now a stand-in for the current layer, but not
      in regular expressions.

  2.  The layer alias name (lppName) is now also tested against the
      regular expression.

* Standard Via selection

  Ctrl-clicking on a selected standard via instance now pops up the
  standard via parameter setting panel, allowing the instance to be
  changed.

* Wire and Polygon Termination

  Pressing Enter now terminates wires and polys being created in the
  respective side-menu commands.  Also, if the click is within
  PixelDelta pixels of the target, the wire or poly will be
  terminated.  This helps ensure termination with ultra-fine grid
  setting.  The PixelDelta variable can be set to change the snap
  pixel value, the default is 3.

* Print Control Panel updated.

  The Print Control Panel has changed.  When the PostScript Line-Draw
  driver is chosen, a new Line Width entry area becomes visible.  This
  can be used to set the line width as rendered in the plot, in points
  (1/72 in).  The PSlineWidth variable, which was an odious hack to do
  the same thing, has been removed.  The default is "0", which means
  to use the minimum line width supported by the printer.

  The Portrait/Landscape selection is now a drop-down menu instead of
  radio buttons, and some controls have changed location a bit.

* The xic --v option now produces three tokens: version osname arch
  E.g., 4.3.1 LinuxRHEL7 x86_64
  
* Many more small tweaks and updates, including the following.

  In the Compare Cells panel with compare flat mode, the Equiv list is
  now explicitly set to the Cells list if nothing is entered. 
  Otherwise file2 would use the default cell, which may not be the one
  listed in Cells.

  The cell hierarchy digest (CHD) default cell is now the first
  top-level physical cell by offset that has instances.  The "has
  instances" in new, avoids choosing an uninteresting default cell.

  The Tree and Info reports from selections in the Cells Listing now
  track the display mode of the listing, rather than the current mode. 
  If the Tree is called from the Cells List, it will no longer update
  when the main window display mode changes, is is "captive" of the
  Cells List.

  New code to handle standard vias when flattening, i.e., using a CHD.
  These vias were excluded before.

  The set current layer by clicking on object function now works for
  zero-width wires as used in electrical mode.

  In the script debugger, Load will now search the current directory
  for the script, before searching the ScriptPath.  The !exec command
  will now check the current directory after the ScriptPath.  Both
  avoid having to add "./" ahead of a script name if the current
  directoiry is not in ScriptPath.


BUGS FIXED
---- -----

* Node (net) name mapping failures fixed.

  Fixed lack of name assignment in the Node (Net) Name Mapping panel. 
  The operation would fail if names are case-insensitive (now the
  default) and the new name contained lower case.

* In the Spice Commandd (side menu) operation, error messages weren't
  being handled.  This was a core leak, too.

* Numerous fixes to standard via handling internally.  Standard vias
  should be handled transparently in all operations.

* In the prompt line text editor, pressing Backspace or clicking
  button 1 in the prompt line now exits "firstinsert" (erase all)
  mode.  The fact that button 1 which resets cursor position didn't do
  this was a bug.  One could start editing a string, use btn 1 to move
  the cursor to the center, use Backspace to erase chars to the
  beginning.  Typing a char would then erase the remainder of the line
  and there would be nothing left but the new character.
