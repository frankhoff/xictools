!!TITLE
<i>Xic</i> Variables
!!HTML
    <i>Xic</i> maintains an internal list of keyword/value
    associations.  Although this list can be used for general
    purposes, there are a number of special keywords, or "variables",
    whose value will affect <i>Xic</i> operation.  Variables are set
    with the <a href="!set"><b>!set</b></a> command, and can be unset
    with the <a href="!unset"><b>!unset</b></a> command.  The script
    functions <a href="funcs:main1:var#Set"><tt>Set</tt></a>, <a
    href="funcs:main1:var#Unset"><tt>Unset</tt></a>, <a
    href="funcs:main1:var#SetExpand"><tt>SetExpand</tt></a>, and <a
    href="funcs:main1:var#Get"><tt>Get</tt></a> also provide an
    interface to this database.  Variables can be set from the <a
    href="techfile:set">technology file</a>, and a number of the
    buttons in menus and various pop-ups really do nothing more than
    control the state of one of these variables.

    <p>
    Any variable name can be set with the <b>!set</b> command.  The
    variables and constructs that have meaning to <i>Xic</i> are
    summarized in the table below.

    These are special <b>!set</b> variables and constructs which have
    significance to <i>Xic</i>.

    <p>
    <dl>
    <dt>(no arg)<dd>
    Pop up a list of the currently set variables.  Variables in this
    list (with the exception of the path variables) can be removed
    with the <b>!unset</b> command.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt>?<dd>
    Pop up a list of the variables that have meaning to <i>Xic</i>.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>@</tt><i>devname</i><tt>.</tt><i>property</i> <i>string</i><dd>
    Set the <i>property</i> on device <i>devname</i> to <i>value</i>. 
    This construct enables <a href="properties">device properties</a>
    to be added to devices via the command line.  The first character
    of the name token must be '<tt>@</tt>', followed by the name of
    the device, a period, and the name of the property to set.  Valid
    property names are "<tt>name</tt>", "<tt>model</tt>",
    "<tt>value</tt>", "<tt>param</tt>", "<tt>other</tt>", and
    "<tt>nophys</tt>".  For backward compatibility, "<tt>initc</tt>"
    is recognized as an alias for "<tt>param</tt>".  An unrecognized
    property name will be saved as an "other" property.

    <p>
    Examples:
    <blockquote>
      <tt>!set @L2.value 2ph</tt><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;sets the value of L2 to 2ph.<br>
      <tt>!set @Moutput.param L=2</tt><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;sets the length parameter of mosfet <tt>Moutput</tt>.
    </blockquote>

    The <i>devname</i> field can be the name of a mutual inductor,
    in which case the valid properties are "<tt>name</tt>" and
    "<tt>value</tt>".

    The following variables control fundamental behavior of the
    <i>Xic</i> program.  These must be specified before reading design
    or technology data.  Unlike all other variables, these can be set
    only from the <a href="initfiles"><tt>.xicinit</tt></a> file,
    which is read before the technology file, or the technology file. 
    These can not be set or unset in a <tt>.xicstart</tt> file, which
    is read after the technology file, unless no technology file is
    read.  They can not be set by any other means. 

    <p>
    The <a href="Set"><tt>Set</tt></a> script function can be used in
    the initialization files to set this variable.  In the technology
    file, the <a href="techfile:set"><tt>!set</tt></a> command should
    be used, and this must appear at the top of the file, before layer
    definitions.

    <a name="DatabaseResolution"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>DatabaseResolution</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> string: "1000", "2000", "5000", or "10000".<br>
    By default, <i>Xic</i> uses an internal resolution of 1000 units
    per micron.  In releases prior to 3.0.12, this was internally
    hard-coded.  As the dimensions used in integrated circuits
    continue to shrink, an option for higher resolution was added
    through use of the <b>DatabaseResolution</b> variable.

    <p>
    The internal resolution can be set with this variable, to one of
    the listed choices.  If unset, 1000 units is used.  This
    resolution applies only to physical data, electrical resolution is
    fixed at 1000.

    <p>
    Superficially, changing the internal resolution has only subtle
    effects from the user's vantage point.  Some of these are:

    <ol>
    <li>If not 1000, four digits following the decimal point are used
    when printing coordinates in microns, in many places in <i>Xic</i>. 
    Otherwise, only three digits are used.

    <p>
    <li>The ultimate zoom-in and grid spacing sizes are smaller for
    higher resolutions.

    <p>
    <li>The size of "infinity", the maximum accessible size for the
    design, becomes smaller as resolution is increased, since
    coordinates are stored internally as 32-bit integers.  For 1000
    units, the field width is approximately 2 meters, which decreases
    to 20 centimeters at 10000 units.  This should still be plenty for
    most purposes.

    <p>
    <li>Layout files produced by <i>Xic</i> will use the internal
    resolution, so that no accuracy is lost.
    </ol>
    </dl>

    <a name="NetNamesCaseSens"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>NetNamesCaseSens</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    By default, <a href="elec:netname">net names</a> are
    case-insensitive in <i>Xic</i>, and saved internally as
    upper-case.  If this boolean variable is set, net names are taken
    as case-sensitive.  This impacts lookup of nets by name and
    comparison of net names for identification and matching purposes,
    as used in the electrical schematic and extraction system.
    </dl>

    <a name="Subscripting"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>Subscripting</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> string.<br>
    In <i>Xic</i>, <a href="elec:netname">net name</a> and <a
    href="elec:vecinst">cell instance</a> indexing</a> can employ
    angle, square, or curly brackets, as in the forms
    <tt>mynet&#60;1></tt>, <tt>mynet[1]</tt>, and <tt>mynet{1}</tt>. 
    These forms are equivalent and can be freely mixed in <i>Xic</i>
    input.

    <p>
    However, on occasion <i>Xic</i> will create a vector name for
    output.  The default is to use angle brackets, but this can be
    changed by setting this variable.  The variable must be set to a
    word starting with one of the letters <tt>a</tt>, <tt>s</tt>, or
    <tt>c</tt>, case insensitive (the "word" can be just the letter). 
    Only the first letter is significant.  The letters signify angle,
    square, or curly brackets.
    </dl>

    <a name="DrfDebug"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>DrfDebug</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    This obscure flag applies when using the <a
    href="ReadDRF"><tt>ReadDRF</tt></a>, <a
    href="ReadCdsTech"><tt>ReadCdsTech</tt></a>, and <a
    href="ReadCniTech"><tt>ReadCniTech</tt></a> technology file
    directives.  If this variable is set, non-serious warnings
    encountered when reading these files will be printed.  One such
    warning is generated by use in the Virtuoso or Ciranova technology
    file of color, stipple, or packet names that have not been defined
    in the display resourse file (DRF).  Since there are defaults,
    these unresolved name references are not a serious problem.

    <p>
    At least one commercial process design kit had lots of these
    issues, and reporting these as warnings on every <i>Xic</i>
    startup became irritating, particularly since it is not something
    that the typical user can fix, or want to bother with fixing. 
    Thus, these not-really-errors are ignored by default, but if the
    user desires then setting this variable will make any such errors
    visible.

    <p>
    This variable must be set before the files are read.  Setting this
    variable at the top of the <i>Xic</i> technology file with the <a
    href="techfile:set"><tt>!set</tt></a> construct is a convenient
    way.

Paths and Directories

    These variables set the <a href="xicpaths">search paths</a> and
    document directory used in <i>Xic</i>.  These have counterpart <a
    href="xic:env">environment variables</a>.  The search paths can
    also be set from the <a href="techfile:paths">technology file</a>.

    <p>
    If not set by any means, internal defaults are used for the search
    paths and document directory.  Under Windows, the default is set
    to point to the actual installation location subdirectories when
    necessary.  Under Unix/Linux, the <a
    href="XT_PREFIX"><b>XT_PREFIX</b></a> environment variable should
    be set to the installation location prefix that effectively
    replaces "<tt>/usr/local</tt>".

    <p>
    Below, <i>PREFIX</i> is obtained from the Windows Registry
    database under Windows, which is defined when the program is
    installed.  Under Unix/Linux, <i>PREFIX</i> is obtained from the
    <b>XT_PREFIX</b> environment variable.  In both cases, the default
    value for <i>PREFIX</i>, if another definition is not found, is
    "<tt>/usr/local</tt>".

    <p>
!! 062109
    <a name="Path"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>Path</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> path string, can't be unset.<br>
    This variable contains the design data search path.  It is always
    defined, and can not be unset.  This path is used to find native
    cell, archive, and library files.

    <p>
    If not set by any means, a default path is used.<br>
    Default: "( <tt>.</tt> )"
    </dl>

!! 061308
    <a name="LibPath"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>LibPath</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> path string, can't be unset.<br>
    This variable contains the startup library search path.  It is
    always defined, and can not be unset.  The library path is used to
    find the technology file, device and model libraries, and other
    initialization files.

    <p>
    Unlike other search paths, the current directory is <i>always</i>
    searched first, whether or not this is indicated in the search
    path string.  If not set by any means, a default library path is
    used.<br>
    Default: "( <tt>.</tt> <i>PREFIX</i><tt>/xictools/xic/startup</tt> )"
    </dl>

!! 061308
    <a name="HelpPath"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>HelpPath</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> path string, can't be unset.<br>
    This variable contains the help search path.  It is always
    defined, and can not be unset.  This path is used to find files
    that contain information for the <a href="helpsys">help
    system</a>.

    <p>
    If not set by any means, a default help path is used.<br>
    Default: "( <i>PREFIX</i><tt>/xictools/xic/help</tt> )"
    </dl>

!! 102208
    <a name="ScriptPath"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>ScriptPath</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> path string, can't be unset.<br>
    This variable contains the script search path.  It is always
    defined, and can not be unset.  This path is used to find script
    and menu files that will appear in the <a href="xic:usermenu"><b>User
    Menu</b></a>.

    <p>
    If not set by any means, a default script path is used.<br>
    Default: "( <i>PREFIX</i><tt>/xictools/xic/scripts</tt> )"
    </dl>

    <p>
    The treatment of any path which is given with a native cell to
    open in the <a href="xic:open"><b>Open</b></a> command can be
    altered with two variables:

!! 061408
    <a name="NoReadExclusive"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>NoReadExclusive</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When a native cell name with a path is opened, the path is
    stripped from the cell name.  If the path is not already in the
    search path, it is added.  Ordinarily, the path is put in front of
    the search path for the duration of the read, so that subcells
    will be opened from the same directory.  If this variable is set,
    the path is not necessarily moved to the front of the search path.
    </dl>

!! 102208
    <a name="AddToBack"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>AddToBack</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    A path stripped from a given cell name in the <b>Open</b> command
    is added to the back of the search path, rather than the front.
    </dl>

    <p>
    The behavior is described below for the various permutations:

    <p>
    <blockquote>
    <b>NoReadExclusive</b> unset<br>
    <b>AddToBack</b> unset<br>
    (default behavior)<br>
    <br>
    The directory is added to the front of the search path during the read. 
    The "." element of the path, if it exists, is moved to the front
    after the read.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    <blockquote>
    <b>NoReadExclusive</b> unset<br>
    <b>AddToBack</b> set<br>
    <br>
    The directory is added to the front of the search path during the read. 
    The "." element of the path, if it exists, is moved to the front,
    and the directory is moved to the end after the read.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    <blockquote>
    <b>NoReadExclusive</b> set<br>
    <b>AddToBack</b> unset<br>
    <br>
    If the directory exists in the path, nothing is changed, otherwise the
    directory is added to the front.  After the read, the "." entry, if it
    exists, is moved to the front.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    <blockquote>
    <b>NoReadExclusive</b> set<br>
    <b>AddToBack</b> set<br>
    <br>
    If the directory exists in the path, nothing is changed, otherwise the
    directory is added to the end. 
    </blockquote>

!! 061308
    <a name="DocsDir"></a>

    <dt><b>DocsDir</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> path to directory.<br>
    The given directory is searched for the release notes, for the <a
    href="xic:notes"><b>Release Notes</b></a> command in the <a
    href="xic:helpmenu"><b>Help Menu</b></a>.

    <p>
    If not set by any means, a default document directory is used.<br>
    Default:  "<i>PREFIX</i><tt>/xictools/xic/docs</tt>"
    </dl>

!! 030413
    <a name="ProgramRoot"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>ProgramRoot</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> string.<br>
    This variable is set by the program to the installation location
    assumed by the program at program start-up.  For example, for
    <i>Xic</i> installed in the standard location, the variable will
    contain the string "<tt>/usr/local/xictools/xic</tt>".  This
    variable is not used by <i>Xic</i>, but is available in scripts so
    that the user can query the value when needing to access files in
    the installation location.  Note that the user can set or clear
    this variable arbitrarily.
    </dl>

    <b>Value:</b> path to file.<br>
    When set, the prompt line messages are copied to the given file. 
    If a file name is not given, or when the variable is unset,
    redirection stops.  The value string can be "<tt>stderr</tt>" or
    "<tt>stdout</tt>" to redirect output to the terminal window
    instead of a file.

    <a name="MouseWheel"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>MouseWheel</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> two floating-point numbers.<br>
    This variable controls the per-click increments for mouse wheel
    panning and zooming of drawing windows.  Without a key held, the
    mouse wheel scrolls drawing windows up/down.  If <b>Shift</b> is
    held, scrolling is right/left.  If <b>Ctrl</b> is held (overrides
    <b>Shift</b>), the mouse wheel zooms out or in.

    <p>
    The string provided to this variable consists of two
    space-separated floating-point numbers, each in the range of 0 -
    0.5.  The first is the pan factor, the second is the zoom factor. 
    The default is <tt>0.1 0.1</tt>.  Larger numbers increase the
    effect per mouse wheel click.  If either number is set to 0, that
    effect (pan or zoom) is suppressed.  Thus, to turn off mouse wheel
    support in drawing windows, give "<tt>0 0</tt>".
    </dl>

!! 061308
    <a name="ListPageEntries"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>ListPageEntries</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> integer 100-50000.<br>
    This sets the number of entries that appear per page in the

    exceeds this number, a page menu will become visible in the
    listing panel.  Each page will contain at most this number of
    entries.  Only the entries for the currently selected page will be

    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    In <i>Xic</i> generation 3, a "local image" may be used to compose
    images for screen rendering.  The display image is composed in
    local memory, and flushed to the screen when drawing is complete. 
    When using X-Windows, this provides much faster rendering of
    complex displays, particularly when running remotely over a
    network, than the standard method of server-side image
    manipulation as used exclusively in previous <i>Xic</i> releases.

    <p>
    The local image method is not used if the hierarchy being shown is
    not complex, i.e., contains few subcells and objects, as the
    conventional drawing mode is quicker in this case.

    <p>
    If this variable is set, the local image feature is disabled, and
    rendering is always performed by server-side functions.  This is
    for debugging, it is not likely that the user will need to set
    this variable.

    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    In normal operation, the screen refreshes are buffered through an
    in-core pixel map.  The geometry is rendered in the map, and when
    finished the map is copied to the screen.  This is generally
    faster than drawing directly to the screen.  When this variable is
    set, all drawing is direct to the screen, i.e.,
    <b>NoLocalImage</b> is implied.  This is intended only for
    debugging purposes.

    For windows that are automatically placed just above the <a

    (such as Mac or KDE), where the shadow falls on the prompt line,
    which can be distracting.  It might also be helpful if the window
    positioning is incorrect, which might occur with some window
    managers.  This variable tracks the state of the <b>Pixels between

    By default, most if not all <i>Xic</i> sub-windows will
    automatically rise to the top if completely covered by the
    <i>Xic</i> main window.  This includes plot windows from
    <i>WRspice</i> running under control of <i>Xic</i> (however most
    window managers don't support this).  If this variable is set, the
    action will be disabled.  This will apply to plot windows from
    <i>WRspice</i> that is started after the variable is set.

    <p>
    Some (probably most) window managers will do this automatically
    for sub-windows, in which case setting this variable will have no
    effect on the <i>Xic</i> sub-windows, but would still affect
    <i>WRspice</i> plot windows if the window manager supports this. 
    The only window manager I know of that supports this is Exceed
    2008, because it is old.  The protocol is deemed a security risk
    and has been disabled in modern window managers for some time.

    <b>Value:</b> string.<br>
    This variable can be used to limit data imported from and exported
    to OpenAccess to physical only or electrical only.  The variable
    tracks the state of the <b>Data to use from OA</b> radio group in
    the <a href="xic:oalib"><b>OpenAccess Libraries</b></a> panel.

    <p>
    If set to "1", or to any text starting with 'p' or 'P', only
    physical layout data will be read from or written to OpenAccess. 
    If set to "2", or to any text starting with 'e' or 'E', only
    electrical data (schematic and symbol) will be read or written. 
    If not set, or set to anything else, both physical and electrical
    data will be read and written.

    <p>
    The restriction applies to conversion to and from OpenAccess,
    by any method in <i>Xic</i>.

    <p>
    One useful observation is that one can import a schematic from
    Virtuoso even if no provision has been made to export pcells. 
    Unless the Express PCell feature is enabled in Virtuoso,
    conversion of Skill-based pcells will fail as they can not be
    evaluated outside of the Cadence environment.  The Express PCell
    feature makes available a cache of pre-built sub-masters that can
    be exported.  Without this, attempting to import physical data
    will produce a lot of errors, which can be avoided if only a
    schematic is needed by importing electrical data only.

    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    In <i>Xic</i> releases prior to 3.2.23, the <tt>log</tt> function
    returned the base-10 logarithm.  This definition was changed in
    3.2.23, and the <tt>log10</tt> function added, for consistency
    with programming languages, <i>WRspice</i>, and most other
    software.  This will require users to update legacy scripts that
    use the <tt>log</tt> function to call <tt>log10</tt> instead. 

    <p>
    This variable provides a temporary fix.  When set, the
    <tt>log</tt> function will return the base-10 value.  However, it
    is strongly recommended that legacy scripts be updated, and this

!! 062715
    <a name="MarkInstanceOrigin"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>MarkInstanceOrigin</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When set, selected physical instances will have the cell origin
    marked with a cross.  This applies to the selection highlighting,
    as well as to the ghost rendition which is attached to the mouse
    pointer during a <a href="xic:move">move</a> or <a
    href="xic:copy">copy</a> operation.

    <p>
    Showing the origin may seem trivial, but marking the origin
    requires a bit of overhead since it requires running a
    transformation and keeping track of an additional redisplay area
    since the origin may be outside of the cell bounding box.  Thus,
    the default is to not show the mark.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the state of the <b>Show origin of selected
    physical instances</b> check box in the <b>Selections</b> page or

    In mathematics, the centroid or geometric center of a
    two-dimensional region is the arithmetic mean of all the points in
    the shape.  When this variable is set, selected objects will mark
    the centroid with a cross.  This applies to the selection
    highlighting, as well as to the ghost rendition which is attached
    to the mouse pointer during a <a href="xic:move">move</a> or <a

    <b>Value:</b> integer 100-1000.<br>
    When <a href="button1">button 1</a> is used for object manipulation
    and editing, there is a time delay which differentiates a "click"
    from a "drag".  This delay, which defaults to 250 milliseconds,
    can be adjusted by setting this variable.  If the user encounters
    difficulty establishing an area select, for example, as opposed to
    a move/copy operation, then setting a longer time delay may be
    advantageous.

    This can be set to an unsigned integer in the range 500-250000. 
    If there are more than this number of objects selected, they won't
    blink in true-color display modes.  If <a
    href="NoPixmapStore"><b>NoPixmapStore</b></a> is set, this
    threshold is divided by 8.  The default if not set is 25000

    There are three styles, selected by giving this property a value
    of 0, 1, or 2.  The default menu, style 0, contains a menu bar
    with entries for categories, such as <b>Sources</b> and
    <b>Terminals</b>.  Style 1 is similar, however the entries are
    alphabetic corresponding to the first letter of the device name. 
    Style 2 provides buttons marked with the device schematic symbol. 
    This style occupies the most screen space, but may be more
    convenient for new users.

    <a name="LabelDefHeight"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>LabelDefHeight</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> real 0.01 - 10.0.<br>
    This sets the minimum label height, in microns, for new text
    labels.  The actual initial height may be larger, depending on the
    zoom factor of the window, but it can not be smaller.  The default
    if this variable is not set is 1.0 micron.

    <p>
    This variable was named <b>DefLabelHeight</b> in releases prior to

    <b>Value:</b> integer >= 6.<br>
    This variable sets the maximum width, in default-sized character
    cells, of a displayed <a href="xic:label#maxlen">label</a>.  If
    the label exceeds this width, it is not shown, and a small box at
    the text origin is shown instead.  The default is 256, so this is
    unlikely to be triggered unless the user resets the value.

    <p>
    The "hidden" status of a label can be toggled by clicking the text
    or box with button 1 with the <b>Shift</b> key held.

    <p>
    This variable was named <b>MaxLabelLen</b> in releases prior to
    4.2.14.

    <dt><b>LabelMaxLines</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> integer >= 0.<br>
    Label text strings may have embedded newline characters which
    cause them to be displayed on multiple lines.  This variable, when
    set to a positive integer value, provides a limit on the number of
    lines that are actually displayed, in labels that respect this
    limit.  Only the first <i>N</i> lines would actually appear in the
    display, where <i>N</i> is given in this property.  If <i>N</i> is
    zero, there is no limit.

    <p>
    Labels observe this limit only if an internal flag is set in the
    label.  Presently, this is set internally for the labels
    associated with <a href="prpty:value"><b>value</b></a> and <a
    href="prpty:param"><b>param</b></a> properties.  The user can
    apply the limit to any label by setting the <tt>LIML</tt> flag in

    <a name="SpotSize"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SpotSize</b> (integer)<dd>
    <b>Value:</b> real 0-1.0.<br>
    When an e-beam mask is written, the layout is rendered using a
    certain pixel size.  This implies a mask resolution, usually cited
    as the "manufacturing grid" or "spot size".  This size may range
    from 0.5 microns for the least expensive masks, down to a few
    nanometers for the most expensive.

    <p>
    <i>Xic</i> has two parameters which deal directly with mask
    resolution.  The <a href="MfgGrid"><tt>MfgGrid</tt></a> set in the
    technology file will force the grid snap points to be multiples of
    the value given.  The <b>SpotSize</b> variable controls use of a
    numerical preconditioner for tiny round objects.  The
    preconditioning should cause the pixel area to be constant with
    respect to positioning and rotation.  This is valuable to
    researchers fabricating circular Josephson junctions using
    inexpensive mask sets (for example).

    <p>
    In "rasterizing" round objects to the e-beam grid, there can be
    numerical problems.  Since the round object is rendered as a
    collection of spot-pixels, the feature is not particularly round,
    but most importantly the number of pixels used may not be well
    defined, and therefor the figure area may not be as expected, or
    consistent.

    <p>
    The internal spot size is used when creating round (disk) objects
    and donuts, but not arc objects or general polygons.  It applies
    to the <a href="xic:round"><b>round</b></a> and <s
    href="xic:donut"><b>donut</b></a> buttons in the side menu, and
    the corresponding script functions, but does not apply to the <a
    href="xic:arc"><b>arc</b></a> button or <a
    href="xic:polyg">general polygons</a>.  The internal spot size is
    also used as the default value for the <a
    href="!tospot"><b>!tospot</b></a> command.

    <p>
    If the <b>SpotSize</b> variable is given a non-negative value,
    this value is used as the internal spot size.  The value is in
    microns, and 1.0 micron is the largest accepted value.  If this is
    zero, then no preconditioning is applied.  If the <b>SpotSize</b>
    variable is unset, the internal spot size will default to the
    <tt>MfgGrid</tt> given in the technology file.  Thus, when a
    manufacturing grid is given, the default is to use preconditioning
    when creating round objects.  This can be suppressed by setting
    <b>SpotSize</b> to zero.  Other than this, there probably is no
    reason to set the <b>SpotSize</b> variable, since it should match
    the <tt>MfgGrid</tt>, unless the user has special requirements.

    <p>
    When the internal spot size has a positive value, objects created
    with the <b>round</b> and <b>donut</b> buttons will be created so
    that all vertices are placed at the center of a spot (i.e., in the
    center of a manufacturing grid cell), and a minimum number of
    vertices will be used.  The <a href="xic:sides"><b>sides</b></a>
    number is ignored.  This applies only to figures with minimum
    radius 50 spots or smaller; the regular algorithm is used
    otherwise.  An object with this preconditioning applied should
    translate exactly to the e-beam grid.  The figures are symmetric
    with regard to rotations in multiples of 45 degrees.

SPICE Interface
!!HTML
    The following <b>!set</b> variables affect the interface to the
    <i>WRspice</i> simulator, and SPICE output in general.

    <p>
!! 061308
    <a name="SpiceListAll"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SpiceListAll</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When set, all devices and subcircuits in the schematic will be
    included in SPICE output.  Otherwise, only devices and subcircuits
    that are "connected" will be included, as explained in the <a
    href="xic:deck"><b>deck</b></a> and <a
    href="xic:run"><b>run</b></a> command descriptions.
    </dl>

!! 061308
    <a name="SpiceAlias"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SpiceAlias</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> string.<br>
    This variable is set to a string which will modify the printing
    of device names in SPICE output.  The aliasing operates on the
    first token of device lines.  The format of the value string is

    <blockquote>
      <i>prefix1</i>=<i>newprefix1</i> <i>prefix2</i>=<i>newprefix2</i> ...
    </blockquote>

    This will cause lines beginning with <i>prefix</i> to have
    <i>prefix</i> replaced with <i>newprefix</i>.  If the
    "=<i>newprefix</i>" is omitted, that line will not be printed. 
    For example, to map all devices that begin with 'B' to 'J', and to
    suppress all 'G' devices, the full command is

    <blockquote>
       <tt>!set SpiceAlias B=J G</tt>
    </blockquote>

    Note that there can be no space around the '='.  After this
    command is given, the indicated mappings will be performed as
    SPICE text is produced. 
    </dl>

!! 012411
    <a name="SpiceHost"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SpiceHost</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> host name string.<br>
    This will set the name of the host which maintains a server for
    remote <i>WRspice</i> runs.  If set, this will override the value
    of the <a href="SPICE_HOST"><b>SPICE_HOST</b></a> environment
    variable.  The host name specified in the <b>SPICE_HOST</b>
    environment variable and the <b>SpiceHost</b> <b>!set</b> variable
    can have a suffix "<tt>:</tt><i>portnum</i>", i.e., a colon
    followed by a port number.  The port number is the port used by
    the <tt>wrspiced</tt> program on the specified server, which
    defaults to 6114, the IANA registered port for this service.  If
    the server uses a non-standard port, and the <tt>wrspice/tcp</tt>
    service has not been registered (usually in the
    <tt>/etc/services</tt> file) on this port, the port number must be
    provided.
    </dl>

!! 022111
    <a name="SpiceHostDisplay"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SpiceHostDisplay</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> X display string.<br>
    This variable can be set to the X display string to use on a
    remote host for running <i>WRspice</i> through a <tt>wrspiced</tt>
    daemon, from <i>Xic</i> in electrical mode.  It is intended to
    facilitate use of <tt>ssh</tt> X forwarding to take care of
    setting up permission for the remote host to draw on the local
    display.

    <p>
    The variable is set automatically from the <a
    href="!ssh"><b>!ssh</b></a> command, or can be set by hand.

    <p>
    When using a remote host, this specifies the X display string to
    use, which is needed for running graphics.  If not set, a display
    name will be created as follows:  If the local <tt>DISPLAY</tt>
    variable is something like "<tt>:0.0</tt>", the remote display
    name will be "<i>localhostname</i><tt>:0.0</tt>".  If the local
    <tt>DISPLAY</tt> variable is already in the form
    "<i>localhostname</i><tt>:0.0</tt>", this is passed verbatim.

    <p>
    One can use <tt>ssh</tt> transport for the X connection on the
    remote system as follows.  Use "<tt>ssh -X</tt>" to open a shell
    on the remote machine.  Type "<tt>echo $DISPLAY</tt>" into this
    window, it will print something like "<tt>localhost:10.0</tt>". 
    Use this value for <b>SpiceHostDisplay</b>.  The <b>!ssh</b>
    command will set the variable automatically.  The shell must
    remain open while running <i>WRspice</i>, exiting the shell will
    close the X connection.

    <p>
    This will work under Windows, if Cygwin is installed, along with
    the OpenSSH package (for the <tt>ssh</tt> command) and the Cygwin
    X server.  One weirdness:  use "<tt>ssh -Y</tt>" instead of
    "<tt>ssh -X</tt>".  The <tt>-Y</tt> option, which applies to
    recent <tt>ssh</tt> versions, is similar to <tt>-X</tt>, but
    overcomes stronger security checks included in recent <tt>ssh</tt>
    implementations.  This seems to be necessary when using the Cygwin
    X server.

    <p>
    <b>Background</b>

    <p>
    In legacy X-window systems, the display name would typically be in
    the form <i>hostname</i><tt>:0.0</tt>, where the <i>hostname</i>
    could be (and usually is) missing.  A remote system will draw to
    the local display if the local hostname was used in the display
    name, and the local X server permissions were set (with
    <tt>xauth</tt>/<tt>xhost</tt>) to allow access.  Typically, the
    user would log in to a remote system with <tt>telnet</tt> or
    <tt>ssh</tt>, set the <tt>DISPLAY</tt> variable, perhaps give
    "<tt>xhost +</tt>" on the local machine, then run X programs.

    <p>
    This method has been largely superseded by use of "X forwarding"
    in <tt>ssh</tt>.  This is often automatic, or may require the
    '<tt>-X</tt>' or '<tt>-Y</tt>' option in the <tt>ssh</tt> command
    line.  In this case, after using <tt>ssh</tt> to log in to the
    remote machine, the <tt>DISPLAY</tt> variable is automatically set
    to display on the local machine.  X applications "just work", with
    no need to fool with the <tt>DISPLAY</tt> variable, or
    permissions.

    <p>
    The present <i>Xic</i> remote access code does not know about the
    <tt>ssh</tt> protocol, so we have to fake it in some cases.  In
    most cases the older method will still work.

    <p>
    The <tt>ssh</tt> protocol works by setting up a dummy display,
    with a name something like "<tt>localhost:10.0</tt>", which in
    actuality connects back to the local display.  Depending on how
    many <tt>ssh</tt> connections are currently in force, the
    "<tt>10</tt>" could be "<tt>11</tt>", "<tt>12</tt>", etc.

    <p>
    In the present case, if we want to use <tt>ssh</tt> for X
    transmission, the display name must match an existing <tt>ssh</tt>
    display name on the remote system that maps back to the local
    display.

    <p>
    If there is an existing <tt>ssh</tt> connection to the remote
    machine, the associated <tt>DISPLAY</tt> can be used.  If there is
    no existing <tt>ssh</tt> connection, one can be established, and
    that used.  E.g., from the <tt>ssh</tt> window, type "<tt>echo
    $DISPLAY</tt>" and use the value printed.

    <p>
    The display name provided by the <b>SpiceHostDisplay</b> variable
    will override the assumed display name created internally with the
    local host name.
    </dl>


!! 022619
    <a name="SpiceInclude"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SpiceInclude</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> file path string.<br>
    This can be set to a file path.  When a SPICE netlist is created
    with this variable set, text will be added to the top of the SPICE
    deck.  If the file exists and is readable, the text from the file
    is added to the deck verbatim.  Othewise, "<tt>.include</tt>
    <i>path</i>" is added, the <i>path</i> being the file path from
    the variable.  This applies when creating SPICE with the <a
    href="xic:deck"><b>deck</b></a> button, or when preparing input
    for the simulator when using the <a href="xic:run"><b>run</b></a>
    button.

!! 061308
    <a name="SpiceProg"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SpiceProg</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> program path string.<br>
    This will set the full path name of the <i>WRspice</i> executable. 
    This is useful if there are multiple versions of <i>WRspice</i>
    available, or the binary has been renamed.  If given, the value
    supersedes the values from environment variables or the
    <b>!set</b> variables described below.
    </dl>

!! 110213
    <a name="SpiceExecDir"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SpiceExecDir</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> directory path string.<br>
    This will set the directory to search for the <i>WRspice</i>
    executable.  If given, the value overrides the <a
    href="SPICE_EXEC_DIR"><b>SPICE_EXEC_DIR</b></a> environment
    variable.  The default search location is
    "/usr/local/xictools/bin", or, if the <a
    href="XT_PREFIX"><b>XT_PREFIX</b></a> environment variable has
    been set, its value will replace "<tt>/usr/local</tt>".
    </dl>

!! 061308
    <a name="SpiceExecName"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SpiceExecName</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> program name string.<br>
    This will set the name of the <i>WRspice</i> binary.  If given,
    the value overrides the <a
    href="SPICE_EXEC_NAME"><b>SPICE_EXEC_NAME</b></a> environment
    variable.  The default name is "<tt>wrspice</tt>".
    </dl>

!! 021912
    <a name="SpiceSubcCatchar"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SpiceSubcCatchar</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> string, single printing character.<br>
    This sets the concatenation character used in <i>WRspice</i>
    subcircuit expansion.  It affects the internally-generated node
    and other names within subcircuits.  Please refer to the
    WRspice-3.2.15 release notes or documentation for a full
    description of the <i>WRspice</i> <tt>subc_catmode</tt> and
    <tt>subc_catchar</tt> variables and their effects.

    <p>
    When running <i>WRspice</i> from <i>Xic</i>, there should not be
    compatibility issues, as <i>Xic</i> will automatically recognize
    the capabilities of the connected <i>WRspice</i> and compensate
    accordingly - as long as the <a href="hypertext">hypertext</a>
    facility is used to define node, branch, and device names.  This
    is true when point-and-click is used to generate names.  However,
    subcircuit reference names that for some reason are entered by
    hand may need to be updated, or a <tt>.options</tt> line added as
    a <a href="spicetext">spicetext</a> label, or the
    <b>SpiceSubcCatchar</b>, <b>SpiceSubcCatmode</b> variables may be
    set to enforce backward compatibility.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>SpiceSubcCatmode</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> string, "<tt>wrspice</tt>" or "<tt>spice</tt>3".<br>
    This sets the algorithm used by <i>WRspice</i> for subcircuit
    expansion.  It affects the internally-generated node and other
    names within subcircuits.  Please refer to the WRspice-3.2.15
    release notes or documentation for a full description of the

    <dt><b>CheckSolitary</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    If set, warning messages will be issued when electrical netlists
    are generated for nodes having only one connection.  This affects
    the <a href="xic:run"><b>run</b></a> and <a
    href="xic:deck"><b>deck</b></a> commands, and the <a

    <dl>
    <dt><b>NoSpiceTools</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When running <i>WRspice</i> from <i>Xic</i>, by default the
    <i>WRspice</i> toolbar is shown, if <i>WRspice</i> is running on
    the local machine.  This gives the user much greater flexibility
    and control over <i>WRspice</i>.  If this variable is set,
    <i>before</i> the connection to <i>WRspice</i> is established, the
    toolbar will not be visible.

    <p>
    In releases 3.0.8 and later, this variable will also control
    toolbar visibility if the <tt>wrspiced</tt> daemon is used. 
    However, this requires <tt>wrspiced</tt> distributed with
    wrspice-3.0.7 or later.  <b>If this variable is set with an
    earlier <tt>wrspiced</tt> release, the <i>WRspice</i> connection
    will not work!</b>

File Menu - Printing

    command.

    <p>
!! 061308
    <a name="NoAskFileAction"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>NoAskFileAction</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    By default, in the <a href="filesel"><b>File Selection</b></a> and
    <a href="xic:files"><b>Path Files Listing</b></a> windows, a
    confirmation pop-up will appear before move/copy/link operations
    on files or directories initiated by drag/drop.  If this variable
    is set, this confirmation will not appear.  The confirmation
    default is safer, but may be annoying to experienced users.

    <p>
    Note:  in releases prior to 3.0.0, there was no confirmation, as
    if this variable were set.
    </dl>

!! 061308
    <a name="DefaultPrintCommand"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>DefaultPrintCommand</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> string.<br>
    Under Unix/Linux/OS X, this variable overrides the default
    operating system command string to print a file.  In Windows, this
    will be the printer name instead.

    <p>
    This should probably be set before the <a
    href="xic:hcopy"><b>Print</b></a> panel is used for the first
    time, as some drivers may copy the initial contents so that
    changing this variable will have no effect.  It can be set in a <a
    href="initfiles">startup file</a>.

    <p>
    If not set, the default print command is "<tt>lpr</tt>" (or
    "<tt>default</tt>" in Windows).  See the man page for <tt>lpr</tt>
    or <tt>lp</tt> for the print options which apply on your system,
    which can be placed in the default string.  In the printer command
    string, the characters "<tt>%s</tt>" are replaced with the name of
    the temporary file to be printed.  If these characters don't
    appear, the file name is tacked on the end of the command string,
    separated by space.
    </dl>

!! 061308
    <a name="NoDriverLabels"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>NoDriverLabels</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    The PostScript hard copy drivers use PostScript text for labels by
    default, not the vector font used on-screen.  This can be
    overridden, and the vector font used, by setting this variable. 
    Multi-line labels are always drawn with the vector font, however.
    </dl>

!! 061308
    <a name="RmTmpFileMinutes"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>RmTmpFileMinutes</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> integer 0-4320<br>
    When a layout or page is <a href="xic:hcopy">printed</a>, a
    temporary file is produced and saved in one of the system
    temporary directories.  By default, these files are not removed. 
    The temporary directories are generally cleared when the system is
    rebooted, or by some other system-level means.

    <p>
    On some operating systems, the print command can include an option
    to delete the temporary source file after the print job is
    complete.  The <b>DefaultPrintCmd</b> variable can be set to
    include this option.

    <p>
    Otherwise, this variable can be set to delete the temporary file a
    number of minutes after the print job is submitted.  On some
    systems, the temporary file is copied into the print job queue, so
    that the temporary file can be deleted almost immediately.  On
    other systems, or for large files, a link into the queue is
    created instead, so that the file must not be deleted until the
    job is complete.  There is no universal way to determine if a
    print job has completed, so we need to wait a reasonable length of
    time before deleting the file.

    <p>
    This variable can be set to the number of minutes to wait before
    deleting the temporary file.  If set to 0, the file will not be
    deleted by this system, as is the case if this variable is not
    set.  The deletion will occur whether or not the application is
    still running.

    <p>
    Currently, this feature is not available on Windows.  It uses the
    Unix <tt>at</tt> command (see the manual page for details).  The
    user must have permission established for this to work.  A message
    is printed in the console when a file is scheduled for deletion,
    or if an error (such as lack of permission) occurs.

    <a name="AskSaveNative"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>AskSaveNative</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When set, the user will be prompted to save the current cell if
    the cell is modified, and would be saved as a native symbol, and a
    new current cell is about to be set.  This was standard behavior
    in releases earlier than generation 4.  Although it is always a
    good idea to save work periodically, the prompt can be annoying to
    experienced users and is now disabled by default.  The user will
    be given the chance to save modified cells when exiting <i>Xic</i>
    in any case.

    <p>
    The <b>Prompt to save modified native cells</b> check box in the
    <a href="xic:edset"><b>Editing Setup</b></a> panel from the
    <b>Edit Menu</b> tracks the state (set or unset) of this variable.
    </dl>

!! 102913
    <a name="Constrain45"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>Constrain45</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When this boolean variable is set, <a href="xic:wire">wire</a> and
    <a href="xic:polyg">polygon</a> vertices are constrained to form
    angles of multiples of 45 degrees.  By default, a "smart" path
    generator is employed, which will construct a valid path to the
    pointer location from the previous point during wire or polygon
    construction.  This will often add two vertices:  a 45 degree
    extension, followed by a Manhattan extension, in order to connect
    the points.  If the <b>Ctrl</b> key is held while the new point is
    defined, the "smart" feature is disabled, and only one new vertex
    is added.  If the <b>Shift</b> key is held, then the 45 degree
    constraint is removed entirely.

    <p>
    When set, rotation angles available in the <a
    href="xic:spin"><b>spin</b></a> command, and translation angles in
    the <a href="xic:strch"><b>Stretch</b></a> command, and the vertex
    editors for polygons and wires, are constrained to multiples of 45
    degrees.  However, pressing the <b>Shift</b> key will remove the
    constraint in these commands while the key is held.  If the
    <b>Constrain 45</b> variable is not set, holding <b>Shift</b> will
    impose the 45 degree angle constraint.  Thus, the <b>Shift</b> key
    inverts the effective state of the <b>Constrain 45</b> variable in
    these commands.

    <p>
    The <b>Constrain angles to 45 degree multiples</b> check box in the
    <a href="xic:edset"><b>Editing Setup</b></a> panel from the
    <b>Edit Menu</b> tracks the state (set or unset) of this variable.

    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    This variable tracks the state of the <b>Merge new boxes and polys
    with existing boxes/polys</b> check box in the <a
    href="xic:edset"><b>Editing Setup</b></a> panel from the <b>Edit
    Menu</b> in a logically inverted sense.

    <p>
    By default, when a new box or polygon object is created in the
    database from the commands in the <a href="sidemenu">side
    menu</a>, the new object is merged with existing boxes and
    polygons on the same layer, if any touch or overlap, to form a
    (generally more complex) polygon in the database.  New wires will
    link with existing similar wires in the database that share an
    endpoint.

    <p>
    If this boolean variable is set, this merging will be disabled. 
    Merging can also be disabled on a per-layer basis with the <a
    href="NoMerge"><tt>NoMerge</tt></a> technology file keyword, which
    prevents merging in all cases on a layer.

    <p>
    The <b>NoMergePolys</b> variable can be set to prevent merging of
    polygons, and will thus revert the merging behavior to that of
    releases prior to 3.1.7.

    <p>
    When reading data from a layout file, a different box
    clipping/merging capability is controlled by the <b>Clip and merge
    overlapping boxes</b> setting in the <b>Setup</b> page of the <a
    href="xic:imprt"><b>Import Control</b></a> panel, and the
    corresponding <a href="MergeInput"><b>MergeInput</b></a> variable.

    When auto-merging new objects (<b>NoMergeObjects</b> is not set),
    only boxes will be clipped and merged, polygons will be ignored,
    if this variable is set.  This reverts to the behavior of releases
    prior to 3.1.7.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the state of the <b>Clip and merge new boxes
    only, not polys</b> check box in the <a

    <dl>
    <dt><b>NoFixRot45</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    There are two modes when rotating boxes/polys by non-Manhattan
    angles.  The default and legacy method is to use an offset
    technique referenced to the lower-left box coordinate, or the
    first vertex of polygons.  This ensures that the same figure is
    generated at any location, and seems to ensure that all angles are
    exactly multiples of 45 or 90, after rotation, in boxes.  However,
    this has the problem that two figures that abut before rotation
    might no longer abut after rotation.  For example, use the <a
    href="!split"><b>!split</b></a> function to split a disk, then
    rotate the collection by 45 degrees.  It is likely that some of
    the figures no longer touch.  If merging is enabled, the disk will
    have lines through it at these points, where the gaps prevented
    merging.

    <p>
    If <b>NoFixRot45</b> is set, the offset fix is not done.  This
    solves the problem of gaps appearing between rotated objects, but
    has its own problems.  Namely, rectangles aren't preserved, angles
    can differ from 45s.  Try rotating a small rectangle, say 3x5
    internal units, by 45s in this mode, and one can see it is a mess. 
    Larger rectangles are not visually distorted, but there are 1-unit
    errors in the vertex placements relative to preservation of 45s or
    90s.  This is probably not acceptable for most work.

    <p>
    Really, rotating by 45 degrees is something best avoided.

    <a name="UndoListLength"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>UndoListLength</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> integer >= 0.<br>
    This variable sets the number of operations remembered in the <a
    href="xic:undo"><b>Undo</b></a> command.  If not set, 25
    operations are saved.  If set to zero, the length is unlimited.

    <p>
    This tracks the setting of the <b>Maximum undo list length</b>

    <a name="MaxGhostDepth"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>MaxGhostDepth</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> integer 0-8.<br>
    This variable sets the maximum expansion depth for instance
    expansion in ghosting.  If not set, this is the same as the normal
    <a href="xic:expnd">expansion depth</a>.  The actual expansion
    depth used in ghosting will not be larger than the normal
    expansion depth, but can be smaller.  For example, setting this to
    0 (zero) will prevent expansion of ghosted subcells entirely.

    <p>
    This tracks the setting of the <b>Maximum subcell depth in
    ghosting</b> menu in the <a href="xic:edset"><b>Editing
    Setup</b></a> panel from the <b>Edit Menu</b>.
    </dl>

!! 100416
    <a name="MaxGhostObjects"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>MaxGhostObjects</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> integer 50-50000.<br>
    This sets the maximum number of objects to render individually as
    "ghosts" attached to the mouse pointer during operations such as
    move and copy.  This can be set to an unsigned integer in the
    range 50-50000.  If there are more than this number, some outlines
    won't be shown, the smaller-area objects will be skipped.  If
    subcells are being expanded, objects are rendered top-down, so
    that if the limit is reached, objects deeper in the hierarchy will
    not be shown.

    <p>
    The default is 4000 if this variable is not set.  If, when moving
    a large number of objects, the pointer motion is too sluggish, the
    user can set this variable to compensate, or can limit the subcell
    expansion depth by setting <b>MaxGhowtDepth</b> if expansion
    causes the problem.

    <p>
    This tracks the setting of the <b>Maximum number of ghost-drawn

    operation in the <b>Edit Menu</b> and the <a
    href="CreateCell"><tt>CreateCell</tt></a> script function can
    overwrite cells already in memory.  This can be dangerous and is
    prevented by default.

    <p>
    The <b>Allow Create Cell to overwrite existing cell</b> check box
    in the <a href="xic:edset"><b>Editing Setup</b></a> panel from the
    <b>Edit Menu</b> tracks the state (set or unset) of this variable.

!! 101212
    <a name="LayerChangeMode"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>LayerChangeMode</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> tri-state.<br>

    <p>
    This variable applies during all move and copy operations, and
    during the <a href="xic:spin"><b>spin</b></a> command in the
    physical side menu and similar.  In these commands, when objects
    being moved or copied are ghost drawn as attached to the mouse
    pointer, it is possible to change the current layer.  The
    operation is then completed by clicking at the new location in a
    drawing window.

    <p>
    This is a tri-state variable.  If not set, there will be no layer
    change in these commands.  Thus by default any current layer
    change made during the command is ignored by the command.  If set
    to the string "<tt>all</tt>" (case insensitive), then a layer
    change will apply to all objects being moved or copied.  All new
    objects will be placed on the new layer, regardless of the
    original layers of the objects.  If set to anything else,
    including to nothing (i.e., as a boolean) then only objects on the
    previous current layer will be changed to the new layer.  Other
    objects will remain on their original layer.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the state of the radio buttons in the
    <b>Layer Change Mode</b> pop-up, which appears when the <a
    href="xic:mclcg"><b>Set Layer Chg Mode</b></a> button in the
    <b>Modify Menu</b> is pressed.

!! 100616
    <a name="JoinMaxPolyVerts"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>JoinMaxPolyVerts</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> integer 0 or 20-8000.<br>
    This variable applies to the <b>Join</b> and <b>Join All</b>
    buttons in the <a href="xic:join"><b>Join or Split Objects</b></a>
    panel (from the <b>Edit Menu</b>), the <a
    href="!join"><b>!join</b></a> command, the join (merging)
    operation when new objects are created, and the associated script
    functions and elsewhere where join operations occur.

    <p>
    This sets an upper bound on the number of vertices in polygons
    created by a join operation.  The default is 600 vertices.  If set
    to 0, no limit is applied.  The variable tracks the <b>Maximum
    vertices in joined polygon</b> entry in the <b>Join or Split
    Objects</b> panel.

    <p>
    There is no internal limit on the vertex count of a polygon in
    memory.  Although setting <b>JoinMaxPolyVerts</b> to 0 allows
    arbitrarily large polygons to be created, one should be reasonable.
    Huge polygons can be cumbersome and inefficient.  Oversize
    polygons and wires will be broken up, if necessary, when a file is
    saved to disk.  For the different formats, the limits are
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><td>native</td> <td>no limit</td></tr>
    <tr><td>CIF</td> <td>no limit</td></tr>
    <tr><td>CGX</td> <td>8000 vertices</td></tr>
    <tr><td>GDSII</td> <td>depends on
     <a href="GdsOutLevel"><b>GdsOutLevel</b></a>,
      max is 8000 vertices</td></tr>
    <tr><td>OASIS</td> <td>no limit</td></tr>
    </table>
    For CIF files, <i>Xic</i> can read/write arbitrarily large
    polygons and wires, but beware that other tools may have built-in
    limits.

    <a name="JoinMaxPolyGroup"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>JoinMaxPolyGroup</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> integer >= 0.<br>
    This variable applies to the <b>Join</b> and <b>Join All</b>
    buttons in the <a href="xic:join"><b>Join or Split Objects</b></a>
    panel (from the <b>Edit Menu</b>), the <a
    href="!join"><b>!join</b></a> command, the join (merging)
    operation when new objects are created, and the associated script
    functions and elsewhere where join operations occur.

    <p>
    When a collection of trapezoids is being combined into polygons
    during a join operation, the collection is first divided into
    connected groups, each of which will be converted to one or more
    polygons.  This variable limits the number of trapezoids in the
    groups.  The default value (when this variable is unset) is 0,
    meaning that there is no limit.  Generally, applying a limit (for
    example, 300) may provide faster join operations, however this
    will leave as separate objects more polygons that could have been
    joined.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the <b>Maximum trapezoids per poly for
    join</b> entry in the <b>Join or Split Objects</b> panel.
    </dl>

!! 100616
    <a name="JoinMaxPolyQueue"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>JoinMaxPolyQueue</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> integer >= 0.<br>
    This variable applies to the <b>Join</b> and <b>Join All</b>
    buttons in the <a href="xic:join"><b>Join or Split Objects</b></a>
    panel (from the <b>Edit Menu</b>), the <a
    href="!join"><b>!join</b></a> command, the join (merging)
    operation when new objects are created, and the associated script
    functions and elsewhere where join operations occur.

    <p>
    When objects are being joined, they are first decomposed into
    trapezoids.  The trapezoids from the objects are saved in a single
    list, and when the list length exceeds a certain value the list is
    sent to the function that recombines the trapezoids into polygons. 
    This variable is used to set the length threshold.  The default
    value (when this variable is unset) is 0, which allows the list to
    grow without bound.  Generally, applying a limit (for example,
    1000) provides faster processing, but will produce more polygons.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the <b>Trapezoid queue size for join</b>
    entry in the <b>Join or Split Objects</b> panel.
    </dl>

!! 100616
    <a name="JoinBreakClean"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>JoinBreakClean</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    This variable applies to the <b>Join</b> and <b>Join All</b>
    buttons in the <a href="xic:join"><b>Join or Split Objects</b></a>
    panel (from the <b>Edit Menu</b>), the <a
    href="!join"><b>!join</b></a> command, the join (merging)
    operation when new objects are created, and the associated script
    functions and elsewhere where join operations occur.

    <p>
    In a join operation, when building up the polygons and the vertex
    limit (<b>JoinMaxPolyVerts</b>) is reached, ordinarily the present
    polygon is output, and a new one is started immediately.  This
    generally produces a set of polygons with complicated and
    seemingly arbitrary borders.  If this variable is set, then the
    polygons are initially built ignoring the vertex limit, and
    polygons that exceed the vertex limit are split into pieces along
    Manhattan bisectors, so that no piece exceeds the vertex count. 
    This gives a much nicer looking layout, but is more compute
    intensive.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the <b>Clean break in join operation
    limiting</b> check box in the <b>Join or Split Objects</b> panel.
    </dl>

!! 100616
    <a name="JoinSplitWires"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>JoinSplitWires</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    This applies to join operations as listed for the variables above,
    but not for the joining when new objects are created.  It also
    applies to the split operation.

    <p>
    By default, wires do not participate in join/split operations,
    these operate on boxes and polygons only.  Wires, however, will be
    joined with other wires on the same layer it they share an
    endpoint and have the same width.  If this variable is set, then
    wires will be treated like polygons in join and split operations,
    but wires never participate in the join operation when new objects
    are created.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the <b>Include wires (as polygons) in
    join/split</b> check box in the <b>Join or Split Objects</b>
    panel.
    </dl>

!! 100616
    <a name="PartitionSize"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>PartitionSize</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> floating-point number.<br>
    This variable applies to layer expression evaluation, including
    from the <a href="xic:lexpr"><b>Evaluate Layer Expression</b></a>
    panel (from the <b>Edit Menu</b>), the <a
    href="!layer"><b>!layer</b></a> and <a
    href="!compare"><b>!compare</b></a> commands, and the <a
    href="AdvanceZref"><tt>AdvanceZref</tt></a> script function.

    <p>
    In releases prior to 3.0.0, this variable was named
    "<b>LayerPartSize</b>".

    <p>
    When geometrical operations are performed over a large area, a
    logical square grid is created over the area relative to the
    lower-left corner.  The operations are performed for each grid
    element that intersects the area, and the results are combined. 
    This can be more efficient than performing the operations over the
    entire area in one shot.  Performance degrades as the amount of
    geometry per grid area increases.  Best performance is probably
    obtained with 10000 or fewer trapezoids per grid.

    <p>
    This variable specifies the size of the grid, in microns, set as a
    floating-point number.  If not set, the default grid size is 100
    microns.  Acceptable values are 1.0 - 10000.0, or 0.  If set to
    0, partitioning is not used.

    <p>
    The variable tracks the <b>Partition size</b> set in the
    <b>Evaluate Layer Expression</b> panel.
    </dl>

!! 100516
    <a name="Threads"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>Threads</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> integer 0-31.<br>
    <font color=red>PRELIMINARY, EXPERIMENTAL!</font>

    <p>
    This will enable new multi-threaded functionality as it becomes
    available.  This is set to the number of helper threads that can
    be called upon to parallelize certain operations.  The best value
    is probably one less than twice the number of available processor
    cores.  It should not be set to a larger value, but one might wish
    to try smaller values.  If unset, or set to 0, the program is
    single threaded.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the <b>Number of helper threads</b> entry in
    the <a href="xic:lexpr"><b>Evaluate Layer Expression</b></a> panel
    from the <b>Edit Menu</b>.

    <p>
    Presently, multi-threading is used when evaluating a layer
    expression using a grid.  Evaluation in each of the grid cells can
    be done in parallel, so these jobs are submitted to the thread
    pool.  One can experiment with the partition size to get fastest
    results, larger partitions are more likely to overcome the
    multi-threading overhead.

    <b>Value:</b> boolean or string<br>
    When a technology file is written with the <a
    href="xic:updat"><b>Save Tech</b></a> button, by default entries
    that would set a parameter to a program default value are omitted,
    as they are redundant and increase the size and complexity of the

    this variable is set to no value, i.e., as a boolean, then these
    lines will be added to the technology file as comments.  If this
    variable is set to any value, then these lines will be added as
    active text.

    <a name="ShowDots"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>ShowDots</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean or "<tt>a</tt>".<br>
    This variable controls the mode used to add connection indications
    (dots) to drawings in electrical mode.  It tracks and sets the
    state of the buttons in the <b>Connection Points</b> panel
    available from the <a href="xic:dots"><b>Connection Dots</b></a>
    button in the <a href="xic:attrmenu"><b>Attributes Menu</b></a>.

    <p>
    If not set, no connection point indication is used.  If set as a
    boolean, or to any value that does not begin with '<tt>a</tt>' or
    '<tt>A</tt>', the normal indication is used, whereby only
    "ambiguous" connection points are marked.  These are wire vertices
    common to two or more wires (except for common end vertices of two
    wires), non-endpoint wire vertices common with device or
    subcircuit terminals, and any point common to three or more
    terminals or wire vertices.

    <p>
    If set to a word starting with '<tt>a</tt>' or '<tt>A</tt>', all
    connections are marked with a dot.

!! 012715
    <a name="FullWinCursor"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>FullWinCursor</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When this variable is set, the mouse cursor consists of
    horizontal and vertical lines that extend completely across the
    drawing window.  The lines intersect at the nearest snap point in
    the current window. 

    <p>
    This variable tracks the state of the <b>Use full-window
    cursor</b> check box in the <b>General</b> page of the <a
    href="xic:attr"><b>Window Attributes</b></a> panel.  The <b>Set
    Attributes</b> button in the <a href="xic:attrmenu"><b>Attributes

    <a name="CellThreshold"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>CellThreshold</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> integer 0-100.<br>
    This sets the size threshold in pixels for physical mode subcells
    to be shown in the display.  If not set, the value is effectively
    4.  Subcells that are smaller than this size in the display are
    either shown as a bounding box, or not shown at all, depending on
    the setting of the <a href="xic:tinyb"><b>Subthreshold
    Boxes</b></a> button in the <b>Main Window</b> sub-menu in the
    <b>Attributes Menu</b> or the <a href="xic:vport">sub-window</a>
    <b>Attributes</b> menu.  If set to 0, all detail is drawn, which
    can significantly increase rendering time.  This applies to hard
    copy output as well as to on-screen rendering.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the <b>Subcell visibility threshold
    (pixels)</b> entry area in the <b>General</b> page of the <a
    href="xic:attr"><b>Window Attributes</b></a> panel from the <b>Set
    Attributes</b> button in the <a href="xic:attrmenu"><b>Attributes

!! 100616
    <a name="GridNoCoarseOnly"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>GridNoCoarseOnly</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When this boolean variable is set, as one zooms out, when the fine
    grid becomes so fine that it is not shown, the coarse grid will
    also not be shown.  Otherwise, the coarse grid (only) will be
    shown.  This tracks the state of the check box in the <b>All
    Windows</b> group in the <b>Style</b> page of the <a
    href="xic:grid"><b>Grid Setup</b></a> panel of the main window. 
    This can be brought up with the <b>Set Grid</b> button in the
    <b>Main Window</b> sub-menu of the <a
    href="xic:attrmenu"><b>Attributes Menu</b></a>.  This applies in
    physical mode only, in electrical mode the coarse grid is not
    shown without the fine grid.
    </dl>

!! 100616
    <a name="GridThreshold"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>GridThreshold</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> integer 4-40, default 8.<br>
    This sets the number of pixels that is the minimum grid spacing,
    in both physical and electrical modes.  If the grid were to have a
    smaller displayed spacing, it will not be shown.  Accepted values
    are in the range 4 - 40, and the value is taken as 8 if this
    variable is not set.  This tracks the value of the numerical entry
    area in the <b>All Windows</b> group in the <b>Style</b> page of
    the <a href="xic:grid"><b>Grid Setup</b></a> panel for the main
    window.  This can be brought up with the <b>Set Grid</b> button in

    Below are general variables relating to data input/output and
    format translation.

    <p>
!! 111908
    <a name="ChdFailOnUnresolved"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>ChdFailOnUnresolved</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    If this variable is set, when doing an operation with a <a
    href="xic:hier">Cell Hierarchy Digest</a> (CHD) that was
    created from a file containing unresolved references (cells that
    were referenced but not defined in the file), and the cells can't
    be referenced through <a href="xic:libs">libraries</a>, the
    operation will fail.  If not set, processing will continue, with
    the non-references either being ignored (e.g., when flattening),
    or converted to empty cells (when reading into the database), or
    propagated to output (when writing output), depending on the
    operation.
    </dl>

!! 120110
    <a name="ChdCmpThreshold"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>ChdCmpThreshold</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> integer >= 0.<br>
    When using a <a href="xic:hier">Cell Hierarchy Digest</a> (CHD),
    by default instance lists larger than 256 bytes are stored in
    compressed form in memory.  This reduces memory use, but there is
    a small speed penalty.

    <p>
    This variable sets the size threshold for compression.  If set to
    a value less than 100, no compression is done.  Otherwise,
    instance lists larger than the set size (in bytes) will be
    compressed.  Experimentation suggests that the largest blocks
    dominate the decompression overhead, so that the value of this
    variable has little effect, except when turning off compression
    entirely.
    </dl>

!! 061408
    <a name="MultiMapOk"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>MultiMapOk</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When set, multiple input/output GDSII layer/datatype mapping to
    <i>Xic</i> layers is enabled (as was always the case in <i>Xic</i>
    releases prior to 2.5.67-5).  This allows objects in GDSII/OASIS
    files to be created on more than one <i>Xic</i> layer, and objects
    on <i>Xic</i> layers to be instantiated more than once in
    GDSII/OASIS output files (each with a different layer/datatype). 
    When not set, each object is created or written once only, using
    the first mapping in the internal list that applies (first
    matching <a href="PhysLayer">layer</a> or <a
    href="StreamOut"><tt>StreamOut</tt></a> keyword found).
    </dl>

!! 102208
    <a name="NoPopUpLog"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>NoPopUpLog</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When set, the <b>File Browser</b> loaded with the log file which
    appears if there were errors or warnings when reading an input
    file or writing output will <i>not</i> appear.  This applies to
    the <b>Open</b> command and equivalent, and the file input/output
    operations in the <b>Convert Menu</b>.  It is not recommended to
    set this in general, but the browser popping up does become
    annoying at times, so this variable can be set when the user knows
    what to expect in the file.
    </dl>

!! 061408
    <a name="UnknownGdsLayerBase"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>UnknownGdsLayerBase</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> integer 0-65535.<br>
    When translating to GDSII or OASIS from a file format that does
    not have layer/datatype numbers, and no mapping can be resolved,
    new layer/datatype combinations are created.  The new layer
    numbers are generated sequentially, starting with the value of
    <b>UnknownGdsLayerBase</b>, or 128 if this variable is not set.
    Each is given the datatype <b>UnknownGdsDatatype</b>.
    </dl>

!! 061408
    <a name="UnknownGdsDatatype"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>UnknownDatatype</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> integer 0-65535.<br>
    This is the datatype assigned to new layers generated using the
    <b>UnknownGdsLayerBase</b>.  If not set, a datatype 128 is used.

!! 081908
    <a name="NoStrictCellnames"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>NoStrictCellnames</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    If the boolean variable <b>NoStrictCellnames</b> is set, there
    will be no checking of cell names for white space, and the legacy
    behavior (in releases prior to 3.0.5) of accepting white space in
    cell names will be enabled.  Otherwise, white space is not allowed
    in cell names, and if such cells are found in an archive being
    read, <a href="cellname">aliasing</a> will be employed to map
    white space characters to underscores.
    </dl>

    <dt><b>NoFlattenStdVias</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When set, and when flattening a physical cell hierarchy, standard
    via instances will be retained as such rather than being converted
    to geometry.  This variable tracks the state of the <b>Don't
    flatten standard vias, move to top</b> check box in the <a
    href="xic:flatn"><b>Flatten Hierarchy</b></a> panel, and the
    <b>Don't flatten standard vias, keep as instances at top level</b>

    </dl>

!! 020918
    <a name="NoFlattenLabels"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>NoFlattenLabels</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When set, and when flattening a cell hierarchy (physical or
    electrical), labels found in subcells are ignored (not copied into
    the current cell).  Labels found in the current cell are retained. 
    This is intended to avoid creating conflicting net labels of wire
    nets from (subnet) labels in subcells.
    This variable tracks the state of the <b>Ignore labels in
    subcells</b> check box in the <a href="xic:flatn"><b>Flatten
    Hierarchy</b></a> panel, and the <b>Ignore labels in subcells</b>
    check boxes in the <b>Setup</b> pages of the <a

    <dt><b>NoReadLabels</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When this variable is set, text label elements will not be read
    from archive files in physical mode.  This may improve efficiency
    if the user is concerned with physical layout data only.  This
    variable tracks the setting of the <b>Skip reading text labels
    from physical archives</b> check box in the <b>Setup</b> page of
    the <a href="xic:imprt"><b>Import Control</b></a> panel from the
    <b>Convert Menu</b>.
    </dl>

!! 061408
    <a name="KeepBadArchive"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>KeepBadArchive</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When generating an archive file and an error occurs, the archive
    file will normally be deleted.  However, if this variable is set,
    the output file will be given a "<tt>.BAD</tt>" extension and
    retained.  This file should be considered corrupt, but may be
    useful for diagnostics.

    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When set, when reading cells into the main database from a <a
    href="xic:hier">Cell Hierarchy Digest</a> (CHD), only the
    requested cell is actually read.  Any subcells of the cell become
    <a href="refcell">reference cells</a> in the main database.  This
    allows editing of the requested cell, and when written to disk the
    complete hierarchy will appear, however loading the whole
    hierarchy into memory is avoided.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the state of the <b>Load top cell only</b>
    check box in the <b>Cell Hierarchy Digests</b> panel.

!! 072710
    <a name="ChdRandomGzip"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>ChdRandomGzip</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean or 0-255<br>
    This variable enables use of a random-access mapping capability
    for <a href="xic:hier">Cell Hierarchy Digest</a> (CHD) accesses to
    gzipped GDSII and CGX files.  This will speed up CHD operations
    that must seek randomly in the input file.

    <p>
    CHDs created while this variable is set will include the mapping
    structure if the input file is gzipped.  The mapping structure
    provides access points to data within the file, spaced by default
    by about 1Mb of uncompressed data.  The map requires about 32Kb
    per access point.  When seeking in the file, one can jump to the
    closest earlier access point, and read to the desired offset. 
    Without the mapping, one can only read forward from the current
    location to the desired location, or rewind to the beginning and
    read to the desired location.

    <p>
    The integer is the number of Mb between access points.  If 0, it
    is as if the variable is not set.  Setting as a boolean, i.e., to
    no value, is equivalent to setting to 1.

    <p>
    This feature is not available in the Linux2, LinuxRHEL3, and
    LinuxRHEL3_64 distributions, where the operating system does not

    <a name="AutoRename"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>AutoRename</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When set, when reading archive files and a cell is encountered
    with the same name as a cell already in memory, the new cell name
    is automatically changed to avoid a clash.  Thus, the <b>Merge
    Control</b> pop-up never appears when this variable is set.  The
    new name has an added suffix "<tt>$</tt><i>N</i>" where <i>N</i>
    is an integer.  When this is set, the <a href="aliasfile">alias
    file</a> (if enabled) is never updated.  A warning is added to the
    log file when a cell name is changed.  This is part of a more
    general <a href="cellname"><b>Cell Name Mapping</b></a>
    capability.  This variable is set when the <b>Auto Rename</b>
    entry is selected in the <b>Default when new cells conflict</b>
    menu in the <b>Setup</b> page of the <a href="xic:imprt"><b>Import
    Control</b></a> panel from the <b>Convert Menu</b>.

!! 022716
    <a name="NoCreateLayer"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>NoCreateLayer</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When set, when reading an input layout file and a layer is found
    that can't be mapped to the existing <i>Xic</i> layers, the read
    will be aborted.  The behavior otherwise is to create new layers
    as needed.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the state of the <b>Don't create new layers

    <a name="NoMapDatatypes"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>NoMapDatatypes</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    This variable affects only the creation of new layers when a GDSII
    or OASIS file is read.  The default behavior is to create a
    separate new <i>Xic</i> layer for each GDSII layer/datatype
    encountered that is not mapped in the technology file.  With the
    variable set, all datatypes on the new GDSII layer are mapped to
    the same (new) <i>Xic</i> layer.  This variable tracks the state
    of the <b>Map all unmapped GDSII datatypes to same Xic layer</b>

    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    If a disk file is opened which contains a cell with the same name
    as one already in memory, and <b>AutoRename</b> is not set, the
    default behavior is to produce a <b>Merge Control</b> pop-up which
    gives the user control over how to proceed.  If this variable is
    set, then the pop-up will not appear, and the default action will
    be taken.  The default action can be specified with the
    <b>NoOverwritePhys</b> and <b>NoOverwriteElec</b> variables.  This
    variable tracks the state of the <b>Don't prompt for overwrite
    instructions</b> check box in the <b>Setup</b> page of the <a

    <dl>
    <dt><b>NoOverwritePhys</b><br>
    <b>NoOverwriteElec</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    These control the default behavior when a cell from a file being
    read conflicts with the name of a cell already in memory.  The
    default behavior is for the cell from the file to overwrite the
    cell in memory.  If <b>NoOverwritePhys</b> is set, the physical
    part of the cell in memory will not be overwritten, and the
    physical part of the cell in the file will be ignored.  Similarly,
    if <b>NoOverwriteElec</b> is set, the electrical part of the cell
    in memory will be preserved, and the electrical part of the cell
    from the file will be ignored.  This variable is set according to
    the choice in the <b>Default when new cells conflict</b> menu in
    the <b>Setup</b> page of the <a href="xic:imprt"><b>Import
    Control</b></a> panel from the <b>Convert Menu</b>.

    <a name="NoOverwriteLibCells"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>NoOverwriteLibCells</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    By default, existing cells in memory can be overwritten if a cell
    of the same name is read when opening cells from an archive file,
    if the overwriting mode is enabled.  Setting this variable will
    prevent existing cells that were opened through the <a
    href="xic:libs">library mechanism</a> (and thus has the LIBRARY <a
    href="xic:cells#flags">flag</a> set) from being overwritten.

    <p>
    The <b>No Overwrite Lib Cells</b> button in the <a

    <a name="NoCheckEmpties"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>NoCheckEmpties</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When set, there is no checking for empty cells as an input file is
    being read, and the pop-up that normally appears when a file is
    opened for editing if there are empty cells in the hierarchy is
    suppressed.  An "empty cell" as listed is a cell that is either
    absent or has no content in both electrical and physical modes. 
    It is possible to check for empty cells at any time with the <a
    href="!empties"><b>!empties</b></a> command.  This variable tracks
    the setting of the <b>Skip testing for empty cells</b> check box
    in the <b>Setup</b> page of the <a href="xic:imprt"><b>Import

    <a name="NoPolyCheck"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>NoPolyCheck</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When this boolean variable is set, the tests for problematic
    conditions such as self-overlap, normally applied to polygons,
    is skipped.  The default behavior is to check each polygon for
    potentially troublesome geometry specification while the polygon
    is being created.  If a layout is known to have only "good"
    polygons, then turning off this test may slightly reduce reading
    time.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the setting of the <b>Skip testing for badly
    formed polygons</b> check box in the <b>Setup</b> page of the <a

    <dt><b>DupCheckMode</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean or string.<br>
    When reading layout data and identical objects or subcells are
    found at the same location, the default action is to issue a
    warning message and read the duplicates into the database.  This
    variable can be set to alter the default behavior.  If set to a
    word starting with '<tt>r</tt>' (case insensitive), the duplicate
    objects or subcells will not be brought into the database.  As
    duplicates are almost always layout errors, it makes sense to
    filter them, though they generally cause no harm.  If this
    variable is set to a word starting with '<tt>w</tt>', only a
    warning will be issued, exactly as if the variable were not set. 
    If set to anything else, including an empty string (i.e., set as a
    boolean), testing for duplicates is disabled.  This may very
    slightly reduce the time to read in a file.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the setting of the <b>Duplicate item

    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When a non-native <a href="pcell">pcell</a> placement is
    encountered when reading file input, the default behavior is to
    not attempt to evaluate the pcell, and assume that the sub-master
    has been exported.  Generally, evaluation of a Skill-based pcell
    will fail, unless Virtuoso is <a href="cdsconnect">accessible</a>
    and the pcell caching has been turned on and is up to date.

    <p>
    If this variable is set, <i>Xic</i> will attempt to evaluate
    foreign pcell placements, which is necessary if the sub-masters have
    not been supplied by another means.  The OpenAccess library that
    supplies the super-master must be open.

    <p>
    If sub-masters are available, it is faster to use them rather than
    to evaluate the scripts and recreate the sub-master.

    When a native <a href="pcell">pcell</a> placement is encountered
    when reading file input, the default behavior is to attempt to
    locate the super-master and evaluate the script, generating the
    sub-master.  It is assumed therefor that the super-master is
    available.  If the sub-masters have been included in the archive
    or otherwise made available, then this variable should be set. 
    Otherwise, the super-masters must be available.

    When this variable is set, and a layout file is being read into
    the database, <a href="xic:box">boxes</a> on the same layer are
    merged together, if possible, as files are being read in. 
    Overlapping boxes are clipped and/or merged, so that in the

    </blockquote>
    where <i>str</i> and <i>sub</i> are text tokens, separated by
    forward slash characters as shown.  In this case if the characters
    at the beginning/end of the cell name (for prefix/suffix) match
    the <i>str</i>, they are replaced by <i>sub</i>.  This is the same
    action as is used in the <a href="!rename"><b>!rename</b></a>
    command.  The string token must match exactly - there is no
    wildcarding.  Either the prefix or suffix, or both, can be

    <dt><b>OasReadNoChecksum</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When set, the reader will ignore a checksum found in the OASIS
    file, if any.  When not set, if a checksum is found, it will be
    compared with a computed checksum, using the method (CRC or
    summation) indicated in the file, and the conversion will fail if
    the checksums are not equal.

    <a name="OasPrintNoWrap"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>OasPrintNoWrap</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    This applies when converting OASIS input to ASCII text.  When set,
    the text output for a single record will occupy one (arbitrarily
    long) line.  When not set, lines are broken and continued with
    indentation.

    Notes:
    <ol>
    <li>These variables apply whenever a layout file is being written,
    in any mode.

    <li>These variables apply to actions initiated from a panel
    containing the <b>Cell Name Mapping</b> control group, and to the
    following script functions:
    <blockquote>
    <a href="ToXIC"><tt>ToXIC</tt></a><br>

    <a href="ToOASIS"><tt>ToOASIS</tt></a><br>
    </blockquote>

    <li>Applies when a file is being written using the <b>Export
    Control</b> panel, and with the script functions listed above.

    <li>The <b>StripForExport</b> variable applies as described below.

    <li>These variables apply when using a <a href="xic:hier">Cell
    Hierarchy Digest</a> (CHD) to access cells for writing.  Reference
    cells are pointers to CHD data.
    </ol>

    <p>
!! 022418
    <a name="StripForExport"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>StripForExport</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When this variable is set, files produced through the <a
    href="xic:exprt"><b>Export Control</b></a> and <a
    href="xic:convt"><b>Format Conversion</b></a> panels will contain
    the basic syntax elements with no extensions.  Thus, they contain
    physical data only.  The <b>StripForExport</b> variable applies
    when writing all output, <b>except</b> when using the <a
    href="xic:sv"><b>Save</b></a> and <a href="xic:save"><b>Save
    As</b></a> buttons in the <b>File Menu</b>, and the equivalent
    text accelerators and including the prompts when exiting the
    program.  It is also ignored when using the <a
    href="Save"><tt>Save</tt></a> script function, but applies in the
    <a href="ToArchove"><tt>ToArchive</tt></a> script function.

    <p>
    Within <i>Xic</i>, <a href="xic:fsaf">archive file</a>
    representations consist of two sequential records in each file. 
    The first record is the physical information, and the second
    record contains the electrical information.  These files should be
    compatible with other CAD systems, as these files are generally
    expected to have only one record, and consequently the electrical
    information may be ignored.  However, one should not count on
    this.  When in effect, only the physical record is output.  This
    produces a file which should be an absolutely conventional
    physical layout file.

    <p>
    Additionally, when <b>StripForExport</b> is set, and when writing
    out a hierarchy from the main database, all cells in the hierarchy
    will be written, whether or not the <a
    href="KeepLibMasters"><b>KeepLibMasters</b></a> variable is set. 
    Thus, the file will not contain unsatisfied cell references, as
    (physical) library cells will be included.  Further, all
    referenced pcell and standard via sub-masters will be written to
    output, similar to the case when the <a
    href="PCellKeepSubMasters"><b>PCellKeepSubMasters</b></a> and <a
    href="ViaKeepSubMasters"><b>ViaKeepSubMasters</b></a> variables
    are set.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the state of the <b>Strip For Export -
    (convert physical data only)</b> check box which appears in the
    <b>Export Control</b> and <b>Format Conversion</b> panels.  This
    button should be active when creating a file to be sent to a
    vendor for use in generating photomasks.  Note that the electrical
    information can never be recovered from a stripped file.

    <dt><b>WriteMacroProps</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When set, output will include <a
    href="prpty:macro"><b>macro</b></a> properties, which are no
    longer in use in 4.3.6 and later.  This variable can be set to
    force generation of these properties, thus providing backwards
    compatibility.
    </dl>

!! 022816
    <a name="KeepLibMasters"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>KeepLibMasters</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When writing an archive file from a hierarchy in the main
    database, cells in the hierarchy that were opened through the <a
    href="xic:libs">library mechanism</a> are by default
    <i><b>not</b></i> included in the file.  References to these cells
    remain, though no library cell definition records will appear in
    output.  The file will not be self-contained, as the library cell
    references are unresolved without the corresponding libraries.

    <p>
    When this variable is set, files produced with the <a
    href="xic:exprt"><b>Export Control</b></a> panel will include all
    cells in the hierarchy, and the file produced will not have any
    unsatisfied references (except for electrical device library
    cells, which are never included in output).  The variable also
    applies to the script functions listed in the notes to the table
    at the top of this section.  It does <i>not</i> apply to the <a
    href="xic:sv"><b>Save</b></a> and <a href="xic:save"><b>Save
    As</b></a> commands, which always omit library cells.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the state of the <b>Include Library Cells</b>
    check box in the <b>Export Control</b> panel.
    </dl>

!! 022816
    <a name="SkipInvisible"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SkipInvisible</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean or string.<br>
    When this variable is set, only layers that are currently visible,
    as selected with <a href="button2">button 2</a> in the <a
    href="layertab">layer table</a> or otherwise, will be converted
    when writing output from the <a href="xic:exprt"><b>Export
    Control</b></a> panel.  If set to a word beginning with '<tt>p</tt>'
    (case insensitive), only invisible physical layers will be
    skipped.  If set to a word beginning with '<tt>e</tt>' (case
    insensitive) only the invisible electrical layers will be skipped. 
    If set to anything else, including the empty string, both physical
    and electrical invisible layers will be skipped.  This variable
    tracks the state of the <b>Don't convert invisible layers</b>
    check boxes in the <b>Export Control</b> panel.
    </dl>

!! 022916
    <a name="NoCompressContext"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>NoCompressContext</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    The <a href="xic:hier">Cell Hierarchy Digest</a> (CHD) is a
    data structure which provides a compact representation of a cell
    hierarchy found in an archive file.  This data structure is used
    in operations where random-access of cells in the archive file is
    required.  This is used in some of the conversion functions
    provided in the <a href="xic:convt"><b>Format Conversion</b></a>
    panel from the <a href="xic:cvrtmenu"><b>Convert Menu</b></a>, and
    elsewhere.

    <p>
    In order to process large files, it is important that the CHD use
    as little memory as possible.  In release 2.5.67 and later, a
    mechanism is used to compress instance lists by default.  This can
    shrink the memory used by the CHD by 50% or more, but requires a
    little more computational overhead.

    <p>
    The digest files written by the <b>Save</b> button in the <a
    href="xic:hier"><b>Cell Hierarchy Digests</b></a> panel and the <a
    href="WriteCellHierDigest"><tt>WriteCellHierDigest</tt></a> script
    function use the compressed instance lists by default, and are
    typically more compact than the older format.  These files have a
    new magic number and can not be read by <i>Xic</i> releases prior
    to 2.5.67. 

    <p>
    This boolean variable, if set, will prevent use of compression in
    the CHD structures, and files written will be backwards
    compatible.  It is unlikely that the user will find it necessary
    to set this variable.
    </dl>

!! 022816
    <a name="RefCellAutoRename"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>RefCellAutoRename</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    This variable applies when writing hierarchies containing <a
    href="refcell">reference cells</a>, which are cells which point to
    data obtained through a <a href="xic:hier">Cell Hierarchy
    Digest</a> but are otherwise empty.  When written to a layout
    file, these cells expand into a full cell hierarchy obtained from
    the CHD.  The output file can not contain more than one cell
    definition for a given name, so by default if a duplicate cell
    name is encountered when writing, that cell definition is simply
    skipped, and all instances of the cell in output will reference
    the original definition.

    <p>
    This is the correct thing to do when duplicate cell names come
    from the same (or an equivalent) CHD, as the duplicates really do
    indicate the same cell.  However, if the names come from different
    CHDs, this could indicate a true name clash.

    <p>
    When this variable is set, names that clash, and that come from
    non-equivalent CHDs, will cause an automatic renaming of the cell,
    and a cell definition will be generated in output under the new
    name.  The subsequent cell instances will be updated to call the
    new name.  Names that clash but come from equivalent CHDs will
    have the cell definition skipped, as in the default mode.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the <b>Use auto-rename when writing CHD
    reference cells</b> check box in the <a href="xic:hier"><b>Cell
    Hierarchy Digests</b></a> panel from the <b>File Menu</b>.
    </dl>

!! 022816
    <a name="UseCellTab"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>UseCellTab</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    This variable enables cell definition substitution when using a <a
    href="xic:hier">Cell Hierarchy Digest</a> (CHD) to access cells
    for purposes other than reading into main memory.  When set, cell
    names found in the <a href="xic:overtab"><b>Cell Table
    Listing</b></a>, which also are visible in the main database will
    replace cells of the same name when accessing a hierarchy through
    a CHD.  This feature can be used to modify cells in a hierarchy
    without having to read the entire hierarchy into main memory.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the state of the <b>Use cell table</b> check
    box in the <b>Cell Hierarchy Digests</b> panel.
    </dl>

!! 061408
    <a name="SkipOverrideCells"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SkipOverrideCells</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    This variable applies only when <b>UseCellTab</b> is set.  When
    this variable is also set, cell names listed in the <a
    href="xic:overtab"><b>Cell Table Listing</b></a> will be skipped,
    rather than substituted.  When writing output, this will produce
    files that have unresolved references, which can be satisfied
    by another source, such as a <a href="xic:libs">library</a>.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the state of the <b>Override</b> and
    <b>Skip</b> radio buttons in the <b>Cell Table Listing</b> panel.
    </dl>

!! 071415
    <a name="Out32nodes"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>Out32nodes</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When set, schematic cell data written to files will use the <a
    href="prpty:node"><b>node</b> property</a> syntax of the 3.2
    branch of <i>Xic</i>, providing limited backward compatibility. 
    This will strip out elements not supported by the earlier syntax,
    such as multi-contact points in symbols.

    <p>
    The files will still not really be backward compatible unless all
    "new" features are avoided.  Setting this variable may be useful
    for the case where 3.2 compatibility is to be preserved for a
    design that originated in 3.2 or earlier, which is read into the
    current release of <i>Xic</i>, tweaked, then saved back to disk.

    <p>
    The variable should not be set unless you explicitly need to
    create backward-compatible files, as it will prevent features from
    working in the resulting files.
    </dl>

!! 022816
    <a name="OutToLower"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>OutToLower</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When set, cell names found in archive files being written that
    are entirely upper case will be mapped to lower case.  A name that
    is mixed-case will not be changed.  This mapping occurs for names
    which are not aliased in an enabled <a href="aliasfile">alias
    file</a>.  This is part of a more general <a
    href="cellname"><b>Cell Name Mapping</b></a> facility, which
    applies in the <a href="xic:exprt"><b>Export Control</b></a>
    panel and elsewhere.
    </dl>

!! 022816
    <a name="OutToUpper"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>OutToUpper</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When set, cell names found in archive files being written that
    are entirely lower case will be mapped to upper case.  A name that
    is mixed-case will not be changed.  This mapping occurs for names
    which are not aliased in an enabled <a href="aliasfile">alias

    </dl>

!! 022816
    <a name="OutUseAlias"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>OutUseAlias</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean or string.<br>
    This variable enables utilization of the <a href="aliasfile">alias
    file</a> when writing to an archive file.  If simply set as a
    boolean, i.e., to no value, the alias file will be read before the
    operation, and created or updated if necessary after the
    operation.  If the variable is set to a word starting with
    '<tt>r</tt>' (case insensitive), then the alias file will be read
    before the operation and used during the operation (if it exists),
    but will not be created or updated after the operation.  If the
    variable is set to a word starting with '<tt>w</tt>' or
    '<tt>s</tt>' (case insensitive), the alias file will not be read
    before an operation, but will be created or updated after the
    operation completes.  This is part of a more general <a
    href="cellname"><b>Cell Name Mapping</b></a> facility, which
    applies in the <a href="xic:exprt"><b>Export Control</b></a>
    panel and elsewhere.

    <a name="OutCellNameSuffix"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>OutCellNamePrefix</b>, <dt><b>OutCellNameSuffix</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> string.<br>
    These variables are most simply set to a text token that is added
    to the beginning or end of cell name strings as archive files are
    being written.  Modifications will not be made to cell names found
    in an enabled alias file.  The strings can also be given in the
    form
    <blockquote>
    /<i>str</i>/<i>sub</i>/
    </blockquote>
    where <i>str</i> and <i>sub</i> are text tokens, separated by
    forward slash characters as shown.  In this case if the characters
    at the beginning/end of the cell name (for prefix/suffix) match
    the <i>str</i>, they are replaced by <i>sub</i>.  This is the same
    action as is used in the <a href="!rename"><b>!rename</b></a>
    command.  The string token must match exactly - there is no
    wildcarding.  Either the prefix or suffix, or both, can be
    defined.  The suffix substitution occurs after the prefix
    substitution.  Either can match the whole cell name if one wants
    to change the name of a single cell.  This is part of a more
    general <a href="cellname"><b>Cell Name Mapping</b></a> facility,

    When set, each object line (boxes, polygons, wires, labels) in CIF

    <a name="GdsOutLevel"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>GdsOutLevel</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> integer 0-2.<br>
    This variable determines the GDSII release level of GDSII output
    files.  The default is release level 7, which was introduced by
    Cadence in 2002.  Previous releases specified a limit of 200 or
    600 polygon vertices (there seems to be some inconsistency in the
    published limit) and 200 vertices for wires.  This applies to
    format releases 3, 4, 5, and 6.  The only difference between these
    formats is the definition of some Cadence-specific data block
    types that are ignored by <i>Xic</i>.  The latest release (7)
    removed these limits.  The limits that remain are due to the block
    size limit (64Kb) of the format, which implies a maximum of 8000
    vertices for polygons and wires.

    <p>
    When writing GDSII output, it may be necessary to enforce the
    limits, if the output is destined for another program which can't
    handle the release 7 limits.  The <i>Xic</i> default is to use the
    release 7 limits.

    <p>
    The <b>GdsOutLevel</b> variable can be set to an integer 0-2.
    The corresponding GDSII format is as follows:

    <dl>
    <dt>level 0: (the default)<dd>
      max poly vertices: 8000<br>
      max wire vertices: 8000<br>
      format level: 7<br>
    <dt>level 1:<dd>
      max poly vertices: 600<br>
      max wire vertices: 200<br>
      format level: 3<br>
    <dt>level 2:<dd>
      max poly vertices: 200<br>
      max wire vertices: 200<br>
      format level: 3
    </dl>

    <p>
    By setting <b>GdsOutLevel</b> to 1 or 2, GDSII files generated
    with <i>Xic</i> should not cause difficulty when read by older
    programs (including old versions of <i>Xic</i>).

    <p>
    This variable tracks the state of the <b>GDSII version number,

    <b>Value:</b> real 0.01-100.0.<br>
    When writing GDSII, the normal MUNITS (machine units) and UUNITS
    (user units) values will be multiplied by this factor, and all
    coordinates in the file will be divided by this factor.  The
    acceptable range is 0.01 - 100.0.  This will apply to <i>all</i>
    GDSII files written.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the <b>Unit Scale</b> entry in the

    <a name="GdsTruncateLongStrings"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>GdsTruncateLongStrings</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>

    The GDSII and CGX formats use a 16-bit integer to store record size,
    limiting the size of records to 64KB.  This prevents storage of
    stings longer than this.  By default, an attempt to write such a
    string to a GDSII or CGX file will generate a fatal error,
    aborting the operation.  If this variable is set, overrunning
    strings will be truncated to maximum possible length, and the
    operation will continue without error.  Warnings will appear in
    the log file, however.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the state of the <b>Accept but truncate
    too-long strings</b> check box in the <b>GDSII</b> and <b>CGX</b>

    GDSII output, though a warning will appear in the log file. 
    Otherwise, this is an error which terminates conversion.

    <p>
    This tracks the state of the <b>Skip layers without Xic to GDSII

    <dl>
    <dt><b>OasWriteCompressed</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean, or the string "force".<br>
    When set, created OASIS files will use compression.  The content
    of all CELL records and name tables will be placed in CBLOCK
    records.  This can significantly reduce file size.  When not set,
    no compression will be used.

    <p>
    By default, very short records are not compressed, as more often
    than not, compression will <i>increase</i> the size of these
    blocks.  If this variable is set to the word "<tt>force</tt>",
    then all blocks are compressed.  This can be used for comparison
    purposes, but is unlikely to yield the best results.  This tracks
    the state of the check box in the <b>OASIS</b> page of the <a

    <a name="OasWriteNameTab"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>OasWriteNameTab</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When set, all strings including cell names, properties, and labels
    are placed in strict-mode tables.  This will in most cases reduce
    file size.  When writing OASIS files with <a
    href="StripForExport"><b>StripForExport</b></a> set, i.e., writing
    physical data only, the offset table is placed in the END record. 
    With <b>StripForExport</b> not set, in general we write two
    sequential OASIS databases into the file, the first for physical
    data, the second for electrical.  In this case, string tables are
    used in the physical part only, and the offset table is placed in
    the START record.  PAD records are added to avoid overwriting data
    since this is a non-sequential operation.  In all cases,
    strict-mode tables are used.

    <p>
    The string tables themselves are written just ahead of the END
    record in all cases (when tables are used).

    <p>
    This tracks the state of the check box in the <b>OASIS</b> page of

    <a name="OasWriteRep"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>OasWriteRep</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> string or boolean.<br>
    When this variable is set, <i>Xic</i> will try to find groups of
    identical objects that can be combined into REPETITION records in
    OASIS output.  This applies to all OASIS output files.  Although
    compute intensive, this can save a lot of space in the output
    file.

    <p>
    If <b>OasWriteRep</b> is not set, subcell and object records are
    written as encountered when traversing the cell structure.  If
    set, objects and subcells will be cached, and similar objects and
    subcells are identified and written using repetition records.

    <p>
    When using repetition, the following procedure is used, where
    "objects" can apply to subcells as well as geometrical objects.

    <ol>
    <li>Instead of directly converting each object, the object is
       saved in a cache.
    <p>
    <li>When a cell traversal is complete or an object count reached,
       the cache is processed, and objects that are identical are
       identified.  The differing objects are sorted to make use of
       modal variables.
    <p>
    <li>For each group of identical objects, those that form a
       spatially linear, periodic "run" are extracted into a new run
       list.
    <p>
    <li>For each list of runs, the runs that are spatially periodic
       are extracted into a new array list.
    <p>
    <li>Each array is written using a 2-dimensional repetition.
    <p>
    <li>Each remaining run is written using a 1-dimensional
       repetition.
    <p>
    <li>The remaining objects, i.e., those not used in an array or
       run, are written using a random repetition.
    </ol>

    <p>
    The details of this process, and whether or not it is applied,
    are controlled by the <b>OasWriteRep</b> variable.  This variable
    can be set to a string containing several tokens, or set as a
    boolean (i.e., set to nothing).  The tokens can appear in any
    order.

    <blockquote>
    <b>OasWriteRep</b>: [<i>word</i>] [<tt>d</tt>] [<tt>r</tt>]
     [<tt>m</tt>=<i>N</i>] [<tt>a</tt>=<i>N</i>] [<tt>x</tt>=<i>N</i>]
     [<tt>t</tt>=<i>N</i>]
    </blockquote>

    <dl>
    <dt><i>word</i><dd>
    This is a token that is not recognized as one of the others.  It
    consists of letters that control the type of object that the
    replication process is applied to.  If the letter is present, the
    corresponding object type will be processed, otherwise the
    replication algorithm will not be applied to that type of object,
    however if this token is not found (no letters appear), all
    objects will be processed.  The letters are:
    <blockquote>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><td width=10><tt>c</tt></td>   <td>subcells</td></tr>
    <tr><td width=10><tt>b</tt></td>   <td>boxes</td></tr>
    <tr><td width=10><tt>p</tt></td>   <td>polygons</td></tr>
    <tr><td width=10><tt>w</tt></td>   <td>wires</td></tr>
    <tr><td width=10><tt>l</tt></td>   <td>labels</td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    For example, "<tt>cp</tt>" would indicate use of repetition for
    subcells and polygons only.  If no token of this type is found,
    then <i>all</i> object types will be processed.
    </dl>

    <p>
    The remaining tokens are identified by the first letter only, and
    the remainder of the token (up to '=' in some cases) is ignored.

    <dl>

    Some debugging info is printed on the console when processing.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>r</tt><dd>
    No attempt is made to find runs or arrays, and all similar
    objects are written using random placement repetitions.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>m</tt>=<i>N</i><dd>
    This sets the minimum number of objects in a run.  The default
    value is 4, which is also the minimum accepted value.  There can
    be no space around the '=', and <i>N</i> must be an integer.  This
    is ignored if <tt>r</tt> is given.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>a</tt>=<i>N</i><dd>
    This sets the minimum number of runs in an array.  The default
    value is 2.  The value can be set to 0 (zero) in which case two
    dimensional repetition finding is skipped.  Otherwise, the value
    must be 2 or larger.  There can be no space around the '=', and
    <i>N</i> must be an integer.  This is ignored if <tt>r</tt> is
    given.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>x</tt>=<i>N</i><dd>
    This sets the maximum number of different objects of a given type
    held in the cache, before flushing occurs.  This does not include
    repetition counts.  The <i>N</i> is an integer in the range 20 -
    50000.  If not set, a default of 5000 is used.  Larger values can
    reduce file size, but can greatly increase writing time due to
    modality sorting.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>t</tt>=<i>N</i><dd>
    This sets the maximum number of similar objects, i.e., those
    subject to repetition analysis, that can exist in the cache before
    flushing.  Extremely large numbers may require excessive time to
    scan for repetitions.  The <i>N</i> is an integer which can be 0
    (zero) in which case no limit is used, or 100 or larger.  The
    default value is 1000000 (one million).
    </dl>

    <p>
    If <b>OasWriteRep</b> is set to an empty string, all objects will
    be processed for replication, using the default run and array
    minimums.

    <p>
    The string for this variable can be composed with the interface
    found in the <a href="xic:oasadv"><b>Advanced OASIS Export
    Parameters</b></a> panel.  The <b>Find repetitions</b> button in
    the <b>OASIS</b>  page of the <a href="xic:exprt"><b>Export
    Control</b></a> panel will set the variable to the current string
    from the interface, or unset the variable.  It the variable is set
    by another method, such as with the <b>!set</b> command, the
    interface will be updated to the parameters as given.  With
    default parameters, the string is empty, so the variable is set as
    a boolean by default.

    <dt><b>OasWriteChecksum</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> string or boolean.<br>
    When not set, no checksum is written to the output.  When set as a
    boolean (i.e., to no value), or to anything other than
    "<tt>2</tt>" or a string beginning with "<tt>ch</tt>", a
    cyclic-redundancy (CRC) checksum is computed and added to the
    file.  If set to "<tt>2</tt>" or a word beginning with
    "<tt>ch</tt>", a byte-sum checksum is added to the file.  This
    variable has a corresponding check box in the <b>OASIS</b> page of
    the <a href="xic:exprt"><b>Export Control</b></a> panel.  This
    controls setting/unsetting as a boolean, thus the check box
    selects CRC checksum or none.

    The normal behavior is to check three and four-sided polygons to
    see if they can be written as (more compact) TRAPEZOID or
    CTRAPEZOID records.  Setting this variable will suppress this,
    providing slightly faster conversion at the cost of larger file

    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    The normal behavior is to leave wires alone, preserving data-type
    integrity.  However, space can be saved by writing two-vertex
    rectangular wires as boxes.  Setting this variable will enable
    this, which may reduce file size at the expense of slightly more
    conversion time.  This variable tracks the <b>Convert Wire to Box

    The OASIS format does not have a native "rounded end" style for <a
    href="xic:wire">wires</a>.  These are normally converted to
    extended-end wires, where the "rounded" part becomes Manhattan. 
    If this variable is set, when converting rounded-end wires to
    OASIS, the wire is converted to a polygon which is shaped the same
    way as all rounded-end wires in <i>Xic</i>.  Use of a polygon
    requires more memory than the wire, but this preserves exactly the
    same geometrical coverage, which is valuable in reducing geometric
    differences if a layout <a href="xic:diff">comparison</a> is
    performed.  This variable tracks the <b>Convert rounded-end Wire

    <b>Value:</b> boolean or string.<br>
    This variable tracks the <b>Property masking</b> menu selections
    in the <a href="xic:oasadv"><b>Advanced OASIS Export
    Parameters</b></a> panel.

    <p>
    There are two properties that are added to text labels by default. 
    These properties are used by <i>Xic</i> and programs based on
    <i>Xic</i> source code, and can be stripped if not needed.  This
    can lead to substantial file size reduction if the file contains
    many text labels.

    <p>
    <b>Property name</b>: <tt>XIC_PROPERTIES</tt><br>
    <b>Property number</b>: <tt>7012</tt>

    <p>
    This property is added when reading GDSII source.  It contains
    values of attributes of the TEXT element.  These have no analogs
    in OASIS format, however if the file is reconverted to GDSII, the
    attributes will be restored.  These attributes are found in the
    following GDSII record types:

    <blockquote>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th>name</th> <th>record</th> <th>description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>ANGLE</td> <td>28</td> <td>Rotation angle of text.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>MAG</td> <td>27</td> <td>Magnification applied to text.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>WIDTH</td> <td>15</td> <td>Width of path used to form
     characters.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>PTYPE</td> <td>33</td> <td>GDSII PATHTYPE used to form
     characters.</td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The property consists of a string containing name/value pairs: 
    the names are the text tokens above, the values are numeric. 
    Tokens are separated by white space.

    <p>
    <b>Property name</b>: <tt>XIC_LABEL</tt><br>
    This is added to all labels to pass the <i>Xic</i> presentation
    attributes.  The string consists of two space-separated unsigned
    numbers:  <i>width</i> and <i>flags</i>.  The <i>width</i> is the
    width of the label bounding box, in containing-cell coordinates. 
    The <i>flags</i> is the <a href="labelflags">label flags</a> word
    used by <i>Xic</i>.

    <p>
    If <b>OasWritePrptyMask</b> is set as a boolean, i.e., to an empty
    string, neither of these properties is written.  If the variable
    is set to an integer value, the two least-significant bits of the
    integer value are flags that mask the creation of these
    properties, according to the table below.  If the variable is set
    to a non-empty and non-integer value, and during conversions only
    (as initiated from the <a href="xic:convt"><b>Format
    Conversion</b></a> panel from the <a
    href="xic:cvrtmenu"><b>Convert Menu</b></a>) then <b>all</b>
    properties are stripped from output.

    <blockquote>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><td><b>Bit 0</b>:</td> <td>If set, <tt>XIC_PROPERTIES</tt> #7012 will
     not be written.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>Bit 1</b>:</td> <td>If set, <tt>XIC_LABEL</tt> will not be
     written.</td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    This variable was named
    "<b>OasWriteNoXicTextPrps</b>" in releases prior to 3.0.0.

Extraction General
!!HTML
    The following variables control features of the general extraction
    and association process.

    <p>
!! 103113
    <a name="ExtractOpaque"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>ExtractOpaque</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When set, <i>Xic</i> will ignore the <tt>OPAQUE</tt> flag and
    perform extraction normally on cells with this flag set.  The
    <tt>OPAQUE</tt> flag would otherwise suppress extraction on the
    contents of the cell.  This flag is set in the <a
    href="prpty:flags"><b>flags</b></a> property of physical cells.

    <p>
    This tracks the setting of the <b>Extract opaque cells, ignore
    OPAQUE flag</b> check box in the <b>Net and Cell Config</b> page
    of the <a href="xic:excfg"><b>Extraction Setup</b></a> panel from
    the <b>Setup</b> button in the <b>Extract Menu</b>.
    </dl>

!! 110413
    <a name="FlattenPrefix"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>FlattenPrefix</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> string.<br>
    This variable can be set to a string containing a space-separated
    list of words.  The words are intended to match cell names or
    classes of cell names.  Cells with names that match are <b>not</b>
    treated as individual cells during <a
    href="xic:extmenu">extraction</a>, instead they are treated as if
    instantiations are part of the containing cell, i.e., they are
    logically <a href="ext:exthier">flattened</a>.  This applies to
    physical cells only, and such cells will have no recognized
    electrical counterpart.

    <p>
    <b>Note:</b> it is probably more convenient to set the <a
    href="prpty:flatten"><b>flatten</b></a> property of physical cells
    that should be flattened into their parent during extraction. 
    Setting this property with the <a href="xic:cprop"><b>Cell
    Property Editor</b></a> will have the same effect as including the
    cell in the <b>FlattenPrefix</b> list, but is persistent when the
    cell is saved.

    <p>
    In the words, the forward slash character ('/') is special, and is
    used to indicate the type of matching.  The possibilities are:

    <dl>
    <dt><i>name</i>[/]<dd>
    This will prefix match cell names, the trailing '/' is optional.  For
    example if <i>name</i> is "<tt>abc</tt>", cell names <tt>abc</tt>,
    <tt>abc123</tt>, and <tt>abcounter</tt> would match.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt>/<i>name</i><dd>
    This will suffix match cell names.  For example, if the word is
    "<tt>/bar</tt>", cell names <tt>bar</tt>, <tt>foobar</tt>, and
    <tt>crossbar</tt> would match.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt>/<i>name</i>/<dd>
    This will literally match a cell name, for example <tt>/foobar/</tt>
    would match only a cell named <tt>foobar</tt>.
    </dl>

    <p>
    This tracks the setting of the <b>Cell flattening name keys</b>
    entry in the <b>Net and Cell Config</b> page of the <a
    href="xic:excfg"><b>Extraction Setup</b></a> panel, which is
    obtained from the <b>Setup</b> button in the <b>Extract Menu</b>.

    <p>
    <b>Note:</b> in <i>Xic</i> releases prior to 3.1.8, this variable
    could be set to a single word only, and prefix matching was always
    employed.  In releases of <i>Xic</i> prior to 2.5.19, this
    variable was named "PnetFlattenPrefix".
    </dl>

!! 103113
    <a name="GlobalExclude"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>GlobalExclude</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> string (layer expression).<br>
    This variable can be set to a layer expression (which includes the
    case of a layer name).  Any object in the layout which touches a
    region where the layer expression evaluates as dark will be
    ignored by the extraction system.  This facilitates use of special
    layers to mask off parts of a layout to be ignored in extraction.

    <p>
    This tracks the setting of the <b>Global exclude layer
    expression</b> entry in the <b>Misc Config</b> page of the <a
    href="xic:excfg"><b>Extraction Setup</b></a> panel, which is
    obtained from the <b>Setup</b> button in the <b>Extract Menu</b>.
    </dl>

!! 103113
    <a name="GroundPlaneGlobal"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>GroundPlaneGlobal</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When set, every object in every cell on a clear-field <a
    href="ext:gplane">ground plane</a> layer is assigned to group 0. 
    If not set, only the largest area group on this layer, in the
    top-level cell, is assigned to group 0.

    <p>
    This tracks the setting of the <b>Assume clear-field ground plane
    is global</b> check box in the <b>Net and Cell Config</b> page of
    the <a href="xic:excfg"><b>Extraction Setup</b></a> panel from the
    <b>Setup</b> button in the <b>Extract Menu</b>.
    </dl>

!! 103113
    <a name="GroundPlaneMulti"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>GroundPlaneMulti</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When set, a layer specified as <a
    href="GroundPlaneClear"><tt>GroundPlaneClear</tt></a> in the
    technology file will be inverted, and the inverted version used
    for grouping and extraction.  The <tt>MultiNet</tt> keyword which
    optionally follows <tt>GroundPlaneClear</tt> in the technology
    file effectively sets this variable.  If this variable is unset,
    then no inversion takes place, and the absence of the
    <tt>GroundPlaneClear</tt> layer is taken to indicate ground (group
    0).  This variable has no effect unless a
    <tt>GroundPlaneClear</tt> layer exists.<br> <b>Note:</b> This
    replaces the <tt>HandleTermDefault</tt> variable which existed in
    earlier <i>Xic</i> releases.  It is part of the <a
    href="ext:gplane">ground plane</a> support in the extraction
    system.

    <p>
    This tracks the setting of the <b>Invert dark-field ground plane
    for multi-nets</b> check box in the <b>Net and Cell Config</b>

    </dl>

!! 103113
    <a name="GroundPlaneMethod"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>GroundPlaneMethod</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> integer 0-2.<br>
    This sets the method used to invert the <a
    href="ext:gplane">ground plane</a> for grouping and extraction, if
    the <tt>MultiNet</tt> keyword has been applied to a <a
    href="GroundPlaneClear"><tt>GroundPlaneClear</tt></a> layer in the
    technology file.  The possible values are integers 0-2, which have
    the same meaning as the integer that optionally follows
    <tt>MultiNet</tt> in the technology file.

    <p>
    This tracks the setting of the inversion method menu in the <b>Net
    and Cell Config</b> page of the <a href="xic:excfg"><b>Extraction

    Menu</b>.
    </dl>

!! 103113
    <a name="KeepShortedDevs"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>KeepShortedDevs</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    By default, if an extracted device is found to have all terminals
    shorted together at the time the device is recognized, the device
    will be ignored.  This will help reject spurious devices from test
    structures, etc.

    <p>
    If the <b>KeepShortedDevs</b> variable is set, then these devices
    will be kept (as in pre-2.5.69 releases).  This flag may be needed
    for LVS to pass, if the schematic contains the shorted devices.

    <p>
    This tracks the setting of the <b>Include devices with terminals
    shorted</b> check box in the <b>Device Config</b> page of the <a
    href="xic:excfg"><b>Extraction Setup</b></a> panel, which is
    obtained from the <b>Setup</b> button in the <b>Extract Menu</b>.
    </dl>

!! 103113
    <a name="MaxAssocLoops"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>MaxAssocLoops</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> integer 0-1000000.<br>
    This variable sets a parameter used by the association algorithm. 
    Presently, it is not expected to be useful to the user, and it is
    recommended that it not be changed.

    <p>
    The variable tracks the setting of the <b>Maximum association loop
    count</b> entry in the <b>Misc Config</b> page of the <a
    href="xic:excfg"><b>Extraction Setup</b></a> panel from the
    <b>Setup</b> button in the <b>Extraction Menu</b>.
    </dl>

!! 103113
    <a name="MaxAssocIters"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>MaxAssocIters</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> integer 10-1000000.<br>
    This variable sets a parameter used by the association algorithm. 
    Presently, it is not expected to be useful to the user, and it is
    recommended that it not be changed.

    <p>
    The variable tracks the setting of the <b>Maximum association
    iterations</b> entry in the <b>Misc Config</b> page of the <a
    href="xic:excfg"><b>Extraction Setup</b></a> panel from the
    <b>Setup</b> button in the <b>Extraction Menu</b>.
    </dl>

!! 103113
    <a name="NoMeasure"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>NoMeasure</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    This turns off the extraction of parametric data for devices
    in the extraction system.  This is mainly for debugging, but may
    save time if the user is interested in topology only.  The
    measurements can be time consuming.

    <p>
    This tracks the setting of the <b>Skip device parameter
    measurement</b> check box in the <b>Device Config</b> page of the
    <a href="xic:excfg"><b>Extraction Setup</b></a> panel from the
    <b>Setup</b> button in the <b>Extract Menu</b>.
    </dl>

!! 110413
    <a name="UseMeasurePrpty"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>UseMeasurePrpty</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When set, the extraction system will read and update (creating if
    necessary) the <a href="measures"><b>measures</b></a> property
    (property number 7106) which is used to <a
    href="ext:meascache">cache</a> measurement results.  The
    measurement of device parameters can be time consuming, and the
    caching can speed up the extraction process significantly. 
    However, using the measurement cache may require user intervention
    to maintain coherency.  If a device layout changes, the user will
    have to manually update the cache in order to obtain updated
    parameters.  With this variable unset, the default condition will
    force actual computation of device parameters, and avoid all use
    of the caching mechanism.  This is appropriate while a cell is
    under development, to avoid cache coherency issues.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the <b>Use measurement results cache
    property</b> check box in the <b>Device Config</b> page of the <a
    href="xic:excfg"></b>Extraction Setup</b></a> panel from the
    <b>Setup</b> button in the <b>Extract Menu</b>.
    </dl>

!! 110413
    <a name="NoReadMeasurePrpty"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>NoReadMeasurePrpty</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    This variable is ignored unless <b>UseMeasureprpty</b> is set. 
    When set, the extraction system will not read the <a
    href="measures"><b>measures</b></a> property (property number
    7106) which is used to <a href="ext:meascache">cache</a>
    measurement results.  When measurement results are required, they
    will be computed.  The property will still be updated, after
    association, if <b>UseMeasurePrpty</b> is set.  Thus, by setting
    this variable and forcing association, one can get a fresh set of
    measurement results into the <tt>measures</tt> properties.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the <b>Don't read measurement results from
    property</b> check box in the <b>Device Config</b> page of the <a
    href="xic:excfg"></b>Extraction Setup</b></a> panel from the
    <b>Setup</b> button in the <b>Extract Menu</b>.
    </dl>

!! 103113
    <a name="NoMergeParallel"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>NoMergeParallel</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    Setting this variable suppresses merging of parallel-connected
    devices during extraction.  This applies to all devices, and
    supersedes the <tt>Merge</tt> directive in the <a
    href="ext:deviceblock">device blocks</a> of the technology file.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the setting of the <b>Don't merge parallel
    devices</b> check box in the <b>Device Config</b> page of the <a
    href="xic:excfg"><b>Extraction Setup</b></a> panel, which is
    obtained from the <b>Setup</b> button in the <b>Extract Menu</b>.
    </dl>

!! 103113
    <a name="NoMergeSeries"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>NoMergeSeries</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    Setting this variable suppresses merging of series-connected
    devices during extraction.  This applies to all devices, and
    supersedes the <tt>Merge</tt> directive in the <a
    href="ext:deviceblock">device blocks</a> of the technology file.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the setting of the <b>Don't merge series
    devices</b> check box in the <b>Device Config</b> page of the <a
    href="xic:excfg"><b>Extraction Setup</b></a> panel, which is
    obtained from the <b>Setup</b> button in the <b>Extract Menu</b>.
    </dl>

!! 103113
    <a name="NoMergeShorted"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>NoMergeShorted</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When including devices with all terminals shorted (the <a
    href="KeepShortedDevs"><b>KeepShortedDevs</b></a> variable is
    set), setting this variable will prevent such devices from being
    merged as parallel devices, if parallel merging is enabled for the
    device type.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the setting of the <b>Don't merge devices
    with terminals shorted</b> check box in the <b>Device Config</b>
    page of the <a href="xic:excfg"><b>Extraction Setup</b></a> panel,
    which is obtained from the <b>Setup</b> button in the <b>Extract
    Menu</b>.
    </dl>

!! 103113
    <a name="IgnoreNetLabels"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>IgnoreNetLabels</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    If set, <a href="ext:netname">net name labels</a> will be ignored
    by the extraction system.  This is probably only useful for
    debugging.  Although this may allow correct association if a net
    name label is wrong, the recommended solution is to correct the
    offending label.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the setting of the <b>Ignore net name
    labels</b> check box in the <b>Net and Cell Config</b> page of the
    <a href="xic:excfg"><b>Extraction Setup</b></a> panel, which is
    obtained from the <b>Setup</b> button in the <b>Extract Menu</b>.
    </dl>

!! 103113
    <a name="UpdateNetLabels"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>UpdateNetLabels</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When set, net name labels will be updated, and new net name labels
    possibly created, after association completes.  The label text is
    obtained from corresponding electrical net names.

    <p>
    This is a dangerous operating mode, as if association fails, it is
    possible that incorrect net name labels will be created.  These
    will subsequently prevent correct association and cause LVS
    failure, until removed or corrected by hand.

    <p>
    When creating library cells, running extraction with this variable
    set can be a final action before saving the finished cell.  This
    must only be done if the cell passes LVS.  The created net name
    labels should improve association efficiency, but are not
    essential.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the state of the <b>Update net name labels
    after association</b> check box in the <b>Net and Cell Config</b>
    page of the <a href="xic:excfg"><b>Extraction Setup</b></a> panel,
    which is obtained from the <b>Setup</b> button in the <b>Extract
    Menu</b>.
    </dl>

!! 112513
    <a name="FindOldTermLabels"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>FindOldTermLabels</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When this variable is defined, <i>Xic</i> will recognize the "term
    labels" of earlier releases as net labels.  In <i>Xic</i>-3, term
    labels were used (optionally) to specify the conductor groups that
    were associated with cell terminals in layouts.  These are labels,
    created by the user on conducting layers, placed over an object on
    the same layer.

    <p>
    The term labels would also be recognized as net labels if the <a
    href="PinPurpose"><b>PinPurpose</b></a> variable is set to an
    empty string, or the "<tt>drawing</tt>" purpose name.  Setting the
    <b>FindOldTermLabels</b> is redundant in that case.  The label
    searches are separate, and both will be done if enabled.

    <p>
    Whether this variable is set or not mirrors the status of the
    <b>Find old-style net (term name) labels</b> check box in the
    <b>Net and Cell Config</b> page of the <a
    href="xic:excfg"><b>Extraction Setup</b></a> panel from the
    <b>Extract Menu</b>.
    </dl>

!! 110213
    <a name="MergeMatchingNamed"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>MergeMatchingNamed</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    If two physically unconnected conductor groups have the same
    logical <a href="ext:netname">net name</a>, if this variable is
    set the groups will be logically merged and treated as a single
    group.  This allows successful top-level LVS of cells containing
    split nets.  Below the top level, split nets are detected by other
    means so setting this variable is not required for successful LVS
    if the top-level cell contains no split nets.

    <p>
    The group names that apply are obtained from net name labels, or
    from cell terminals that have been placed by the user.  By
    default, net name matching is case-insensitive, though this can be
    changed with the <a
    href="NetNamesCaseSens"><b>NetNamesCaseSens</b></a> variable.  The
    name matching also treats as equivalent various subscripting
    delimiters, as listed in the description of the <a
    href="Subscripting"><b>Subscripting</b></a> variable.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the state of the <b>Merge groups with
    matching net names</b> check box in the <b>Net and Cell Config</b>
    page of the <a href="xic:excfg"><b>Extraction Setup</b></a> panel,
    which is obtained from the <b>Setup</b> button in the <b>Extract

    </dl>

!! 103113
    <a name="MergePhysContacts"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>MergePhysContacts</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When set, additional association logic is employed to detect and
    account for split nets in instance placements.  A "split net" is a
    logical net consisting of two or more disjoint physical conductor
    groups.  The disjoint parts of the net are connected when
    instances are placed, through parent cell metalization.  If the
    schematic shows the net fully connected in the master, LVS will
    fail on the parent unless this variables is set.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the state of the <b>Logically merge physical
    contacts for split net handling</b> check box in the <b>Misc
    Config</b> page of the <a href="xic:excfg"><b>Extraction
    Setup</b></a> panel, which is obtained from the <b>Setup</b>
    button in the <b>Extract Menu</b>.
    </dl>

!! 110613
    <a name="NoPermute"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>NoPermute</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When this variable is set, the <a href="ext:assoc">association
    algorithm</a> will not attempt to use symmetry trials to find a
    solution.  Symmetry trials are normally used to iterate through
    permutations when searching for a solution.  During a trial, a
    particular set of associations is assumed, and the algorithm
    continues.  If an inconsistency is found later, the associations
    made during the trial are reverted, and a new trial is started.

    <p>
    Many circuits do not require a permutation search.  In some
    circuits, though, the permutation search can be a very
    time-consuming process.  In circuits where association is known to
    fail perhaps because the wiring is incomplete, setting this
    variable will save time.  This variable is mostly for debugging,
    or for cases where association is not needed.  Of course, if a
    permutation search is needed and not performed, LVS will fail.

    <p>
    Permutes are also skipped if a device or subcircuit is found that
    can not possibly be associated.

    <p>
    This tracks the setting of the <b>Don't run symmetry trials in
    association</b> check box in the <b>Misc Config</b> page of the <a

    <a name="PinLayer"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>PinLayer</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> string.<br>
    If this variable is set to a layer name (or layer-purpose pair
    name) all <a href="ext:netname">net name labels</a> must appear on
    the named layer.  The "<tt>pin</tt>" purpose, and any setting of
    the <b>PinPurpose</b> variable, are ignored.

    <p>
    The label will be associated with the conducting object containing
    the label origin that is highest (farthest from the substrate) in
    the <a href="layertab">layer table</a>.  Possible ambiguity with
    the associated layer makes this scheme not recommended, but
    support is present for compatibility with older cell libraries,
    such as the open-source CMOS libraries from Oklahoma State
    University.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the <b>Net label layer</b> entry in

    <dl>
    <dt><b>PinPurpose</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> string.<br>
    This applies when the <b>PinLayer</b> variable is not set.  By
    default, <a href="ext:netname">net name labels</a> must reside on
    a <a href="layers">layer-purpose pair</a> where the purpose name
    is "<tt>pin</tt>".  However, if this variable is set to another
    valid purpose name, then that name will be required of net labels
    instead.

    <p>
    If the property is set to an empty string (i.e., as a boolean), the
    "<tt>drawing</tt>" purpose is assumed.  One could equivalently
    give the name explicitly.  This is not really recommended as it
    can be inefficient.

    <a name="RLSolverDelta"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>RLSolverDelta</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> floating point >= 0.01.<br>
    It this value is set, the resistance/inductance extractor will
    assume this grid spacing, in microns.  The number of grid cells
    enclosed in the device will increase for physically larger
    devices, so that larger devices will take longer to extract.  If
    this variable is set, the other <b>RLSolver</b> variables are
    ignored.  Setting this variable may be appropriate if all
    resistors are "small" and dimensions conform to a layout grid.

    <p>
    This tracks the setting of the <b>Set/use fixed grid size</b>
    entry in the <b>Device Config</b> page of the <a

    <a name="RLSolverTryTile"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>RLSolverTryTile</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    If set, the extractor will attempt to use a grid that will fall on
    every edge of the device body and contacts.  The device and
    contact areas must be Manhattan for this to work.  If such a grid
    can be found, and the number of grid cells is a reasonable number,
    this will give the most accurate result.

    <p>
    This tracks the setting of the <b>Try to tile</b> check box in the
    <b>Device Config</b> page of the <a

    <dl>
    <dt><b>RLSolverGridPoints</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> integer 10-100000.<br>
    When not tiling (<b>RLSolverTryTile</b> is not set), this sets the
    number of grid points used for resistance/inductance extraction. 
    This number will be the same for all device structures, so that
    computation time per device is nearly constant.  Higher numbers
    give better accuracy but take longer.  The value used if not set
    is 1000.

    <p>
    This tracks the setting of the <b>Set fixed per-device grid cell
    count</b> entry in the <b>Device Config</b> page of the <a

    <dl>
    <dt><b>RLSolverMaxPoints</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> integer 1000-100000.<br>
    When tiling (<b>RLSolverTryTile</b> is set), the maximum number of
    grid cells is limited to this value.  If the tile is too small, it
    will be increased in size to keep the count below this value, in
    which case the tiling will not have succeeded so there may be a
    small loss of accuracy.  Using a large number of grid points can
    take a long time.  The value used if not set is 50,000.

    <p>
    This tracks the setting of the <b>Maximum tile count per

    <a name="SubcPermutationFix"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SubcPermutationFix</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    Setting this variable enables additional <a
    href="ext:assoc">association</a> logic.  It applies when there is
    perfect topological matching between layout and schematic, but <a
    href="xic:lvs">LVS</a> is failing due to different permutations of
    permutable subcell contacts being assumed in the electrical and
    physical parts.  setting the variable will enforce the electrical
    permutation on the physical solution, which will allow LVS to pass
    if the permutation difference was the only issue.

    <p>
    This should no longer be needed, as the two-pass association
    algorithm in current use should resolve these cases automatically. 
    This variable should therefor not be set in general, but it is
    possible that it might allow successful LVS in some obscure case.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the <b>Apply post-association permutation
    fix</b> check box in the <b>Misc Config</b> page of the <a
    href="xic:excfg"><b>Extraction Setup</b></a> panel, which is
    obtained form the <b>Setup</b> button in the <b>Extract menu</b>.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>VerbosePromptline</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    When set, lots of messages will be printed on the prompt line
    during extraction.  Otherwise not much is printed, which may speed
    things up.  This variable is linked to the <b>Be very verbose on
    prompt line during extraction</b> check box of the <b>Misc
    Config</b> page of the <a href="xic:excfg"><b>Extraction

    <a name="ViaCheckBtwnSubs"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>ViaCheckBtwnSubs</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    By default, it is assumed that connections between subcells will
    be made by touching metal only.  This includes the case where the
    metal is from a flattened wire-only cell, as would be provided by
    via cells as described <a href="xic:excfg#via">here</a>.  One can
    easily adapt layout methodology where this is true.  Otherwise,
    this variable can be set, which will cause explicit testing for
    the presence of vias between subcircuit nets.  This is a very
    expensive operation.

    <p>
    Whether this variable is set or not tracks the state of the
    <b>Check for via connections between subcells</b> check box in the
    <b>Net Config</b> page of the <a href="xic:excfg"><b>Extraction
    Setup</b></a> panel from the <b>Extract Menu</b>.
    </dl>

!! 091614
    <a name="ViaSearchDepth"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>ViaSearchDepth</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> non-negative integer.<br>
    If we have intersecting areas of top and bottom conductor, and we
    are searching for an area of <a href="xic:excfg#via">via
    material</a> that would connect the two metal objects, this sets
    the depth in the current cell hierarchy to search.  The default is
    zero, indicating to search the current cell only.  Generally,
    layout methodology can easily ensure that this value can be safely
    zero, but there may be cases that require extraction where such
    methodology was not practiced.  In such a case, where the
    methodology is completely unknown, this value should be set to a
    large number (internally it is limited to 40, the maximum cell
    hierarchy depth) which will ensure that all via-induced
    connections are found.  This can dramatically increase extraction
    time.

    <p>
    The value of this variable tracks the <b>Via search depth</b>
    entry area in the <b>Net Config</b> page of the <a
    href="xic:excfg"><b>Extraction Setup</b></a> panel from the
    <b>Extract Menu</b>.
    </dl>

!! 071820
    <a name="ViaConvex"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>ViaConvex</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    This applies when checking for connectivity through a via during
    extraction.  When set, all non-rectangular vias are assumed to be
    convex polygons.  The test region is taken as a small rectangle
    centered on the via bounding box.  This simplifies and should
    speed testing.  It is intended specifically for circular vias, as
    used in superconductive electronics.  It has no effect on
    rectangular vias.  It should <b>not</b> be set if any vias are
    non-convex polygons, as incorrect results may occur.

    <p>
    Whether or not this variable is set tracks the state of the <b>Assume
    convex vias</b> check box in the <b>Net Config</b> page of the
    <a href="xic:excfg"><b>Extraction Setup</b></a> panel from the
    <b>Extract Menu</b>.

    <p>
!! 051809
    <a name="QpathGroundPlane"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>QpathGroundPlane</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> integer 0-2.<br>
    This variable controls how the <b>"Quick" Path</b> command in the
    <a href="xic:exsel"><b>Path Selection Control</b></a> panel uses
    the inverted ground plane.  Normally, during extraction, if the <a
    href="GroundPlaneClear"><tt>GroundPlaneClear</tt></a> keyword has
    been given, an inverted ground plane is created on a temporary
    layer for internal use.  Since the <b>"Quick" Path</b> mode
    operates outside of the extraction system, the inverted ground
    plane may or may not be available.  The choices are:

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>0</tt><dd>
    Use the inverted ground plane if available.  This is the default. 
    If an inverted ground plane has already been created and is
    current, it will be used when determining paths.  If the ground
    plane does not have a current inversion, the absence of the layer
    will imply a ground contact, as in extraction without the <a
    href="GroundPlaneClear"><tt>MultiNet</tt></a> keyword.  This
    choice avoids the sometimes lengthly inversion computation, but
    makes use of the inversion if it has already been done.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>1</tt><dd>
    Create the inverted ground plane if necessary, and use it.  If the
    extraction system would use an inverted ground plane, it will be
    created if not already present and current.  The path selection
    will include the inverted layer.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>2</tt><dd>
    The <b>"Quick" Path</b> mode will never use the inverted ground
    plane.

    will be considered for inclusion in the path extracted with the
    <b>"Quick" Path</b> button in the <a href="xic:exsel"><b>Path

    Selections</b> button in the <b>Extract Menu</b>.  If this
    variable is set, objects on layers with the <a
    href="Conductor"><tt>Conductor</tt></a> attribute will be allowed. 
    The <tt>Routing</tt> attribute implies <tt>Conductor</tt>, but may
    be more restrictive.

    If set, the <b>spice</b> field (if activated) in the file produced
    from the <a href="xic:pnet"><b>Dump Phys Netlist</b></a> command
    will include capacitors representing the computed wire net
    capacitance to ground.  The <tt>Routing</tt> layers must have the
    <tt>Capacitance</tt> keyword applied in the <a

    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    In the <a href="xic:sourc"><b>Source SPICE</b></a> command,
    ordinarily only devices which have fixed (user-specified) device
    names will have properties updated.  This is to avoid errors,
    since the internally generated names can change, and may not match
    those in the SPICE file.  If this variable is set, the default
    action is to update all devices.  This variable corresponds to the

    commands.  If not set, the name "<tt>tbar</tt>" will be assumed,
    if that name is found for a terminal device in the device
    library.  If not found, the name "<tt>vcc</tt>" will be assumed. 
    If this variable is set to a name, that name must match the name

    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    During <a href="xic:lvs">LVS</a> analysis, the electrical
    (schematic) part of the design is used as the basis for recursion
    through the hierarchy.  Thus, physical subcells that have no
    connection to the circuit will not be detected, and are basically
    ignored.  However, an explicit test is performed for such cells,
    and those found will be listed in the LVS report.  If this
    variable is set, the presence of such cells will force LVS
    failure, otherwise they are ignored for comparison purposes.

    <p>
    This variable tracks the state of the <b>fail if unconnected

    <b>Value:</b> string.<br>
    This variable can be set to a string, which will be included in
    the argument list when capacitance extraction is initiated through
    the interface, with the <b>Run Extraction</b> button in the
    <b>Run</b> page of the <b>Cap Extraction</b> panel, or through the
    <a href="!fc"><b>!fc</b></a> command.  The variable tracks the
    <b>FcArgs</b> text entry area in the <b>Run</b> page of the <b>Cap
    Extraction</b> panel, from where the variable is most conveniently
    set or edited.

    <p>
    If the interface detects that <i>FasterCap</i> from
    <tt>FastFieldSolvers.com</tt> is being used, and this entry is
    empty, the default argument string
    <blockquote>
    <tt>-b -a0.01</tt>
    </blockquote>
    will be imposed.  A "<tt>-b</tt>" option will always be added if
    missing from the <i>FasterCap</i> arguments list, as this argument
    is necessary for correct <i>FasterFap</i> operation in this mode. 
    The "<tt>-a</tt>" option is almost always used, as it specifies
    auto-refinement, however it is technically not necessary and won't
    be imposed if not given, except in the case where no arguments are
    given at all.

    while the run is in progress.

    <p>
    It is not clear why there would be any reason to run in the

    The capacitance extraction interface uses a special layer for
    masking of objects to be included in the capacitance extraction
    run.  By default, this layer is named "<tt>FCAP</tt>".  If any
    shapes exist on this layer in the current cell hierarchy, all
    objects will be clipped by these shapes before capacitance
    extraction.  If no shapes are found on this layer, then all
    objects in the current cell hierarchy will be included in

    to being saved in a file.  The console is the shell window from
    which <i>Xic</i> was started.  This allows the user to monitor the
    run, and abort if something isn't correct.

    <p>
    This will also apply if the program is being run in the
    foreground, however operation is a bit different.  In this case, a
    "<tt>| tee</tt>" is added to the command string ahead of the
    output file name.  There are two implications:  the text will be
    block buffered, and therefor won't appear in the window
    immediately, and in Windows, there is no native <tt>tee</tt>
    command so that the operation may fail.  However, a <tt>tee</tt>
    command is provided with the Cygwin tools, and there are other
    sources.  In the normal case of running in the background, output
    will again be block buffered under Windows, but there is no
    requirement for a <tt>tee</tt> command.

    the number given.  The refined panels are output into the list
    file, which consequently can grow large.

    <p>
    When not set, no such refinement is done.  It should not be set for

    <a name="HelpDefaultTopic"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>HelpDefaultTopic</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> string.<br>
    If this variable is set to an empty string (i.e., as a boolean)
    the default help window which normally appears when the
    <b>Help</b> button in the <a href="xic:helpmenu"><b>Help
    Menu</b></a> is pressed does not appear.  The <a
    href="xic:help">help mode</a> is still set, so help can be
    obtained in the usual way by pressing buttons or through other
    actions, only the initial window is suppressed.

    <p>
    Otherwise, this variable can be set to a URL or help system
    keyword, which will be shown in the initial window when the
    <b>Help</b> menu button is pressed.
    </dl>

!! 061408
    <a name="HelpMultiWin"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>HelpMultiWin</b><dd>
    <b>Value:</b> boolean.<br>
    This variable, when set, causes the help system to use a new
    window for each menu item or screen element clicked on in <a
    href="helpsys">help mode</a>.  If not set, the original help
    window is reused.

    <p>
    The state of this variable tracks the <a
    href="xic:multw"><b>Multi-Window Mode</b></a> button in the <a
    href="xic:helpmenu"><b>Help Menu</b></a>.
    </dl>
