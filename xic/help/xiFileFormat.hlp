    <p>
    This section describes the extensions to the CIF and GDSII formats
    used by <i>Xic</i>.  The CGX file format, designed to be a more
    efficient replacement for GDSII and released into the public
    domain by Whiteley Research Inc., is described in a <a
    href="cgxformat">separate section</a>.  The extensions are
    designed to accommodate the electrical information and certain
    properties.  When strict conformance to the standard format is
    required, such as when exporting physical layouts to a mask
    vendor, the <a href="xic:exprt#strip"><b>Strip For Export</b></a>
    button in the <a href="xic:exprt"><b>Export Control</b></a>
    panel should be used to strip out all extensions, leaving only the
    physical layout.

    <p>
    The GDSII (Stream) format is owned by Cadence, Inc., and is
    described in documentation available from Cadence (specifically
    the <u>Design Data Translators Reference</u>, which is updated
    periodically), which may be available on the internet.

    <p>
    In <i>Xic</i>, cell names are not limited in length.  The cell
    names can contain any characters valid in a file name with the
    exception of ';', which is reserved in the CIF-like syntax used
    for native cell files.  For portability, it is recommended that
    cell names use only the GDSII allowed characters, which are the
    alpha-numerics plus '_', '$', and '?'.  In older GDSII
    specifications (release 3), cell names were limited to 32
    characters, so it may be wise to observe this limit in <i>Xic</i>.

    <p>
    Archive files created by <i>Xic</i> generally consist of two
    records, the first containing the physical information, and the
    second containing electrical information.  If there is no
    electrical information, the second block is not written.  Each
    block is an individual representation of the archive file type,
    i.e., they each parse as a complete "file".  GDSII files written
    in this manner are generally portable to other CAD systems (format
    extensions appear in the electrical block only), as reading will
    terminate at the end of the physical block, and the following
    electrical block will be ignored.  However, in specific instances
    where this proves not to be true, the <b>Strip For Export</b>
    button, which eliminates the electrical block, should be used.

    <p>
    The same comments apply to OASIS and CGX formats, however CGX is
    not known to be supported by other CAD vendors at this time.

    <p>
    CIF files use extensions unique to <i>Xic</i>, so will likely not
    be portable to other CAD systems unless <b>Strip For Export</b> is
    used.  These extensions are described below.

    <h2>GDSII Format and Extensions</h2>

    The GDSII format provides a compact, binary representation of a
    design hierarchy.  Though the standard format is intended for
    physical data, minor extensions are used by <i>Xic</i> to allow
    storage of the electrical information as well.

    <p>
    A GDSII file consists of a sequence of data blocks.  The first
    four bytes of the block provide the block type and size.  Integers
    and floating point numbers have defined representations in GDSII,
    so conversion is necessary from most machine representations. 
    This section will describe the extensions only.

    <p>
    A GDSII file can be decomposed into an ASCII representation with
    the <a href="xic:convt"><b>Format Conversion</b></a> panel found
    in the <b>Convert Menu</b>.  The resulting file prints out the
    characteristics of each block, plus the block offset within the
    file and messages indicating extensions and errors.  A file in
    this format can be reconverted to GDSII.  Generally, there is a
    one to one correspondence between items in the text representation
    and blocks in the GDSII file, thus one can learn much about the
    structure of the GDSII file by examining the text representation.

    <p>
    When the <b>Strip For Export</b> button in the <b>Export
    Control</b> panel is active, GDSII files produced from this panel
    adhere to the strict GDSII standard and contain only physical
    data.  Otherwise the file produced will contain extensions.  Such
    files are not guaranteed to be readable by other software (but
    they generally are).

    <p>
    The file with extensions contains two concatenated GDSII record
    sets.  The first contains the physical data.  The physical records
    are zero padded to the next 2Kb block boundary, at which point the
    electrical records begin.  Beyond this arrangement the extensions
    are as follows:

    <ol>
    <li>The data size limitation on attribute strings is increased and
      the total size of attribute lists is unconstrained.  Attribute
      strings can be up to 16Kb in length.
    <li>Attribute records can appear ahead of cell definitions, thus
     giving properties to cell definitions.  This violates the
     standard GDSII record sequencing.
    </ol>

    <p>
    Both of these extensions are necessary to accommodate to
    properties found in the electrical design data, and are used in
    the electrical part of the file only.

    <h3>Physical Mode Cell Properties</h3>

    Certain features, such as <a href="xic:pcells">parameterized
    cells</a>, require cell properties in physical mode.  Cell
    properties are also used to save the grid/snap values in the
    top-level cell, and can be added by the user to support other
    applications.
    
    <p>
    The GDSII format has no provision for storing properties of cell
    definitions.  In electrical mode, <i>Xic</i> uses the format
    extension mentioned above.  We can't use extensions in physical
    mode, since that would make the files non-portable, so we have to
    fake it.

    <p>
    In releases prior to 2.5.66, the cell properties were saved in a
    dummy label.  This label was written on layer/datatype 0/0 at the
    origin, and was given the text string "<tt>CELL PROPERTIES</tt>". 
    Physical cells with properties would have this label added in
    GDSII output.  When reading in the GDSII file, the label would be
    stripped, and the properties from the label object would be
    applied to the containing cell.

    <p>
    However, when using direct conversions from the <a
    href="xic:convt"><b>Format Conversion</b></a> panel from the <a
    href="xic:cvrtmenu"><b>Convert Menu</b></a>, the file would be
    converted as-is, so that if converting to <i>Xic</i> native cell
    files (for example), the converted cells would contain the
    "<tt>CELL PROPERTIES</tt>" labels and would <b>not</b> have the
    properties set.

    <p>
    Release 2.5.66 and later no longer create a "<tt>CELL
    PROPERTIES</tt>" label.  Instead, a "SNAPNODE" record with a PLEX
    number <tt>0xffffff</tt> is created, at the origin on layer 0 with
    nodetype 0.  This is an obscure data type that is more likely to
    be invisible in the GDSII database.  Unlike a label, it should not
    be visible in most other readers.

    <p>
    The current release reader will still process the "<tt>CELL
    PROPERTIES</tt>" label if found, for backwards compatibility.  In
    addition, it will also process these labels, and the SNAPNODE
    records, when doing direct conversions, so that the properties are
    assigned correctly in this case.

    <p>
    Neither construct is/was added to the output file if the
    <a href="StripForExport"><b>StripForExport</b></a> button or
    variable is active.

    <p>
    <b><font color=red>COMPATIBILITY WARNING</font></b><br>
    <i>Xic</i> releases prior to 2.5.66 will not process cell
    properties in GDSII files created with this release and
    subsequent.  Physical mode cell properties are used by <i>Xic</i>
    to implement parameterized cells, to save the grid parameters used
    in the top-level cell, and can be added by the user for third-party
    purposes.  Loss of cell properties will cause parameterized cells
    to lose the parameterization feature, but still behave as normal
    cells.  Loss of the grid parameters may require the user to reset
    these manually.  Files read with older versions will generate
    "<tt>unsupported record type PLEX</tt>" warnings in the log file
    if any of the new-style records are encountered.

    <h2>The CIF File Format</h2>

    The Cal (Tech) Intermediate Format (CIF) was developed at Cal Tech
    in the earliest days of design automation.  The format, such as it
    is (there are many dialects), is public domain.  Though possibly
    still used in educational and research environments, it is unusual
    in current commercial IC engineering.

    <p>
    The format used in native cell files and the device library
    file is an extension of the CIF file format.  Through extension,
    this format is robust enough to meet the needs of <i>Xic</i> while
    retaining the syntactic simplicity of the original format.  This
    section outlines the basic syntax of CIF, while the next section
    will provide details about the extensions used by <i>Xic</i>.

    <p>
    In CIF, "lines" are terminated with semicolons.  The line feed and
    carriage return characters are taken as white space and ignored,
    and may not even be present, so the "lines" are actually logical
    only.

    <p>
    Comments in CIF are enclosed in parentheses.  Comments are ignored
    in CIF, however <i>Xic</i> uses special comment lines for various
    purposes, as will be seen in the next section.
    <blockquote>
    <tt>(This is an example comment);</tt>
    </blockquote>
    Note that this (and all) CIF lines must be terminated with ';'.

    <p>
    The first one or two non-whitespace characters of a line (i.e.,
    following ';') are used as a command key.  In strict CIF, this key
    is a letter, though numbers have been adopted as widely-used
    extensions.

    <p>
    Historically, in CIF the word "symbol" has been used to refer to
    what in current terminology is referred to as a cell.  When
    describing CIF, the terms "symbol" and "cell" are used as
    synonyms.

    <p>
    The <tt>DS</tt> (define symbol) directive begins a symbol (cell)
    definition.
    <blockquote>
    <tt>DS</tt> <i>symnum A B</i>;
    </blockquote>
    In strict CIF, symbols do not have names, but are referenced by
    symbol number.  The assigned symbol number (an integer) follows
    <tt>DS</tt>.  The remaining two parameters are for scaling.  Each
    coordinate in the symbol is scaled by <i>A</i>/<i>B</i>.  The use
    of two integers rather than a single floating point value was once
    considered a speed optimization.  <i>Xic</i> never uses the
    <i>symnum</i> or scaling factors in native files:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>DS 0 1 1;</tt>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The definition of a symbol is terminated with a <tt>DF</tt> line,
    <blockquote>
    <tt>DF;</tt>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Within the symbol definition, there are layer directives, followed
    by geometry specifications, and subcell calls.  A layer directive
    consists of a line with the form
    <blockquote>
    <tt>L</tt> <i>layername</i>;
    </blockquote>
    where <i>layername</i> is a name for a layer.  In traditional CIF,
    the <i>layername</i> is an alphanumeric text token of four
    characters or fewer.  All geometry which follows a layer
    declaration will be assigned to that layer, until the next layer
    declaration.

    <p>
    There are three types of CIF geometric objects used by <i>Xic</i>: 
    boxes, polygons, and wires.  Boxes have the form
    <blockquote>
    <tt>B</tt> <i>width height x y</i> [<i>rx ry</i>];
    </blockquote>
    where the first two parameters are the box width and height, and
    the second two parameters are the coordinates of the midpoint of
    the box.  The last two parameters are optional, and indicate a
    rotation.  The two numbers define a vector with respect to the
    origin, and the angle represents the angle by which the box should
    be rotated.  <i>Xic</i> never uses the rotation parameters for
    boxes.  Non-Manhattan rotated boxes are converted to polygons.

    <p>
    Ordinarily, boxes are rendered according to the attributes of the
    layer on which the box is defined.  In <i>Xic</i> electrical mode,
    boxes on the SCED layer use that attribute, however boxes on other
    layers are rendered as a dotted outline with no fill.  The SCED
    layer defaults to solid fill, other layers default to empty fill. 
    All physical layers default to empty fill.

    <p>
    Polygons are specified with <tt>P</tt> followed by x-y coordinate
    pairs.  The first and last coordinates must be the same,
    indicating closure of the polygon.
    <blockquote>
    <tt>P</tt> <i>x0 y0 x1 y1 ... xN yN x0 y0</i>;
    </blockquote>
    The polygon is rendered using the fill attributes of the layer on
    which the polygon is defined.  There should be at least four pairs
    of coordinates defined for a polygon.

    <p>
    Wires are fixed-width paths.  A wire is specified with <tt>W</tt>
    followed by the width, which is followed by x-y coordinate pairs
    representing the path.
    <blockquote>
    <tt>W</tt> <i>width x0 y0 x1 y1 ... xN yN</i>;
    </blockquote>
    In electrical mode, the basic line primitive is a zero width wire. 
    In physical mode, wires are defined with finite width as a
    physical necessity.  The coordinates will form the vertices of the
    path.  A wire can technically consist of a single vertex, which
    will be rendered as a box with the width of the wire.  This
    construct is disallowed in <i>Xic</i>, and should be avoided. 
    Wires are rendered with the fill attribute of the layer on which
    the wire is defined.

    <p>
    A symbol call (subcell) is indicated with a <tt>C</tt>, followed
    by the symbol number, followed by a transformation specification. 
    The transformation if made up of components representing
    translation, rotation, and reflection.  Translation is indicated
    by <tt>T</tt> followed by the translation:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>T</tt> <i>x y</i>
    </blockquote>
    Rotation is specified by <tt>R</tt>, followed by two numbers which
    represent a vector with respect to the origin, the angle of which
    is the angle of rotation.  Many parsers recognize only orthogonal
    rotations.  <i>Xic</i> recognizes angles that are multiples of 45
    degrees.
    <blockquote>
    <tt>R</tt> <i>rx ry</i>
    </blockquote>
    Mirroring about the y-axis is specified with
    <blockquote>
    MX
    </blockquote>
    and about the x-axis with
    <blockquote>
    MY
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The transformation specification is a concatenation of these
    directives, which are evaluated in sequence to obtain the
    coordinate mapping from the cell coordinates in the symbol being
    instantiated to the cell coordinates of the parent of the
    instance.  The overall syntax is
    <blockquote>
    <tt>C</tt> <i>symnum transform</i>;
    </blockquote>
    where an example would be
    <blockquote>
    <tt>C 0 R 1 0 T -1000 0;</tt>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The parsing is terminated with an end directive:
    <blockquote>
    End
    </blockquote>
    This line need not be terminated with a semicolon.

    <p>
    The base coordinate system specified for CIF uses 100 units per
    micron.

    <h2>CIF Format Extensions</h2>

    There have been numerous extensions to the CIF syntax used to
    enhance the capabilities of the original format.  Some of these
    extensions have been accepted widely and have become essentially
    part of the standard.  <i>Xic</i> uses these extensions, plus some
    further extensions, in native format files and in files converted
    to CIF without the <b>Strip For Export</b> button active.  These
    extensions to the basic CIF syntax are enumerated below.  Unless
    stated otherwise, the extension is applied identically in native
    cell files and CIF output.

    <p>
    When writing a cell hierarchy in CIF format, when the top-level
    cell is known, the writer will add a transform-less symbol call of
    the top-level symbol just before the final <tt>End</tt> line. 
    Thus, the two final lines look like
    <blockquote>
    <tt>C</tt> <i>top_cell_number</i><tt>;</tt><br>
    <tt>End</tt>
    </blockquote>
    MOSIS specifically requires this.  If the top level cell is
    unknown, which is true when translating directly from another
    format, this is skipped.  <i>Xic</i> does not require or use this
    line.

    <ol>
    <li>Layer names can be arbitrarily long in CIF files generated or
    read by <i>Xic</i>, there is no four-character limit as in
    traditional CIF.  In order to produce traditional CIF output,
    layer names should follow the traditional CIF limitation.  Unlike
    some extensions, there is no provision for enforcing traditional
    CIF output, when layer names are arbitrary.  Prior to release 4.0,
    <i>Xic</i> used CIF-style layer names.

    <p>
    <li>If a semicolon is preceded by a backslash character, the
    reader will strip the backslash and propagate the semicolon as an
    ordinary character, and <b>not</b> as a record terminator.  Thus,
    label and property strings may contain semicolons if they are
    "hidden" with a backslash.

    <p>
    <li>Comment, label, and property strings can be arbitrarily long. 
    Other interpreters, and older releases of <i>Xic</i>, may limit
    these lengths.  Beware that the GDSII and CGX file formats have a
    64KB record size limit and cannot accommodate strings that would
    overrun this limit (see the <a
    href="GdsTruncateLongStrings"><b>GdsTruncateLongStrings</b></a>
    variable).

    <p>
    <li>The <tt>DS</tt> (define symbol) line is always followed by a
    cell name extension line of the form
    <blockquote>
    <tt>9</tt> <i>symbol_name</i>;
    </blockquote>
    This extension is widely used, and is a standard means for
    including the symbol names within the CIF framework.

    <p>
    In native cell files, however, the DS line is <i>preceded</i> by
    the symbol name line.

    <p>
    <li>In <i>Xic</i> releases prior to 3.0.0, the symbol number part of
    an instance call was set to 0, i.e., the call sequence was always
    <blockquote>
    <tt>C 0 ...;</tt>
    </blockquote>
    when cell name extensions were used.  Since cell names were
    provided through the extensions, the cell numbering is unneeded. 
    In current releases, the cell numbering is retained and will
    appear in the instance calls, in all CIF output.

    <p>
    <li>In CIF, the name of the cell being instantiated may precede the
    "<tt>C ...</tt>" (symbol call) line, using the same format as
    associated with the <tt>DS</tt> line, i.e.
    <blockquote>
    <tt>9</tt> <i>master_name</i>;<br>
    <tt>C</tt> <i>N</i> <tt>...;</tt>
    </blockquote>
    This is redundant in CIF, since the master name can be obtained
    from the symbol number.  It is required in native cell files, as
    there is no symbol numbering.

    <p>
    In native cell files only, instead of a cell name, the string can
    contain two words separated by white space.  The first word is
    a path to an <a href="xic:fsaf">archive</a>
!!IFDEF OpenAccess
    file, <a href="xic:libs">library</a>, or the name of an <a
    href="xic:oalib">OpenAccess library</a>.
!!ELSE
    or href="xic:libs">library</a> file.
!!ENDIF
    The second token would be the cell or library reference name.  If
    the first word is a path to an archive file, the cell name is
    optional if the file contains only one top-level cell, this cell
    would be understood.  When the cell is read into <i>Xic</i>, the
    master and its hierarchy will be read from the specified source.

    <p>
    For example:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>9</tt> <tt>/path/to/directory/containing/myfile.gds mycell</tt>;<br>
    <tt>C 0 ...;</tt><br>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    If a native cell with instance calls in this form is saved as a
    native cell, the instance calls will retain this special form.

    <p>
    Cell files that contain instance calls of this form can be
    produced in a couple of ways.  One would first read the target
    archive cell into <i>Xic</i>, then create a new cell, and place
    one or more instances of the target cell.  One can then write the
    new cell to disk as a native cell, and modify the instance calls
    with a text editor.  Alternatively, one can use the rename
    function of the <a href="xic:cells"><b>Cells Listing</b></a> panel
    to change the name of the target cell to the two words as would
    appear in the instance call, i.e., for example the full path to
    the source file name followed by the cell name, separated by
    space.  The rename will accept this form.  Then write the current
    cell to a native cell file.  There will be no need for text
    editing in this case.  After doing this, however, you have a cell
    in memory with a bizarre name, best to clear the database or
    restart <i>Xic</i>.

    <p>
    <li>Labels are specified with a unique syntax:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>94 &#60&#60</tt><i>label string</i><tt>>></tt> <i>x y flags width
     height</i>;
    </blockquote>
    This is a further extension of a widely-used extension for labels,
    which does not have the <i>flags</i>, <i>width</i>, or
    <i>height</i> fields and the delimiters around the label.  The
    original extension also required that the string contain no white
    space.

    <p>
    The <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> are the dimensions of the
    untransformed bounding box of the label.  The label will be
    stretched to fill this area.  The label is surrounded by
    <tt>&#60&#60 >></tt>.  The <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are the reference
    coordinates, which by default is the lower left corner of the
    bounding box.  The <i>flags</i> entry specifies transformations
    applied to the label at the reference point, and other <a
    href="labelflags">rendering information</a>.

    <p>
    <li>Cells and instances can be preceded by properties of the
    general form
    <blockquote>
    <tt>5</tt> <i>prop_num prop_string</i>;
    </blockquote>
    The property number <i>prop_num</i> is an arbitrary integer.  The
    property string begins with the first non-space character
    following the integer, and ends with the semicolon (the semicolon
    is not included).  The string can contain any alphanumeric,
    punctuation or white space but not ';' for obvious reasons.  There
    are a number of properties used by <i>Xic</i>, particularly in
    electrical mode.  This extension is widely used.
    </ol>

    <p>
    <i>Xic</i> writes the electrical information in a second symbol
    definition which immediately follows the physical cell definition
    in native files, but after the terminating token of the physical
    cell.  Similarly, when <i>Xic</i> writes a CIF file without the
    <b>Strip For Export</b> function active, the electrical CIF
    representation immediately follows the physical CIF data, after
    the termination token.

    <p>
    In <i>Xic</i> releases prior to 3.0.0, the cell terminator was the
    single character <tt>E</tt>.  This was used in both native cell
    files and unstripped CIF.  In the present release, the cell
    terminator is always "<tt>End</tt>" in CIF, "<tt>E</tt>" in
    native cell files.

    <p>
    Whether or not these extensions are used when writing CIF output
    is controlled by a set of flags, which can be individually set
    from the <b>CIF</b> page of the <a href="xic:exprt"><b>Export
    Control</b></a> panel.  Actually, there are two banks of these
    flags, one bank is used when <b>Strip For Export</b> is set, the
    other bank is used when <b>Strip for Export</b> is unset.  In the
    case of <b>Strip For Export</b> set, the flags all default to 0,
    so no extensions are used.  In the case of <b>Strip For Export</b>
    unset, the flags all default to 1, so all extensions are used.
 
    <p>
    The user can set these flags individually through the <b>Extension
    Flags</b> menu in the <b>CIF</b> page of the <b>Export Control</b>
    panel.  The bank of flags being set is determined by the state of
    the <b>Strip For Export</b> button and variable.

    <p>
    The flags in the menu have the following effects.
 
    <dl>
    <dt><b>scale extension</b><dd>
    Traditional CIF has a fixed resolution of 100 units per micron.
    This extension will add a comment of the form
    <blockquote>
        <tt>(RESOLUTION</tt> <i>nnn</i><tt>);</tt>
    </blockquote>
    near the top of the file, and use <i>nnn</i> as the file
    resolution.  The CIF reader must check for this comment and scale
    numerical values accordingly.

    <p>
    <i>Xic</i> normally uses <a href="xicdb#units">internal units</a>
    in unstripped CIF and native files, signaled with the addition of
    a comment line ahead of the first symbol definition something
    like:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>(RESOLUTION 1000);</tt>
    </blockquote>
    <i>Xic</i> will look for this comment, and interpret the
    coordinates accordingly.  If no comment is found, the CIF default
    of 100 units per micron is assumed.  <i>Xic</i> will always use
    internal units when writing a CIF file when this extension is enabled,
    and 100 units otherwise.

    </blockquote>
    may be added ahead of wires to specify an end style.  The values
    of <i>n</i> are 0 (flush ends), 1 (rounded ends), or 2 (extended
    ends, the default).

    <p>
    This extension was used in <i>Xic</i> prior to 2.5.23.  It has
    been superseded by <b>wire extension new</b>, which will have
    precedence if both extensions are enabled.

    </blockquote>
    The end style of wires is not part of traditional CIF.  In this
    extension, the wire end style 0-2 immediately follows the
    '<tt>W</tt>', with the rest of the line as in traditional CIF. 
    The end style is the same as the GDSII path type:  0 for flush
    ends, 1 for rounded ends, and 2 for extended square ends.

    <h2>Native Cell File Format</h2>

    Native cell files use a modified <a href="CIF">CIF</a> format,
    which includes a number of format <a
    href="symfilefmt#cifext">extensions</a>.  Each file can contain
    two cell definitions:  one for physical geometry, and the second
    for electrical (schematic) data.  The physical information is
    found first.  The electrical cell definition is optional, it may
    be absent or empty.  An empty physical cell definition is created
    if there is no physical information, thus all native cell files
    produced by <i>Xic</i> will contain a physical cell definition. 
    The parser will also recognize schematic files from the
    <b>Jspice3</b> program, which have a similar format, but no
    physical cell definition.

    <p>
    The basic file layout is shown below.

    <blockquote>
      <tt>(Symbol</tt> <i>symbol_name</i><tt>);</tt><br>
      <tt>(</tt><i>RCS_ID</i><tt>);</tt><br>
      <tt>(PHYSICAL);</tt><br>
      <tt>(RESOLUTION 1000);</tt><br>
      <tt>9</tt> <i>symbol_name</i><tt>;</tt><br>
      <tt>DS 0 1 1;</tt><br>
      <i>physical data ...</i><br>
      <tt>DF;</tt><br>
      <tt>E</tt><br>
      <tt>(ELECTRICAL);</tt><br>
      <tt>(RESOLUTION 1000);</tt><br>
      <tt>9</tt> <i>symbol_name</i><tt>;</tt><br>
      <tt>DS 0 1 1;</tt><br>
      <i>electrical data ...</i><br>
      <tt>DF;</tt><br>
      <tt>E</tt><br>
      <i>SPICE listing</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The first line is a mandatory CIF comment giving the symbol (cell)
    name.  The second line is an optional comment providing an ID
    field to be used with the RCS/CVS code control programs.  These
    programs are used to manage large projects with multiple
    designers.  Other comment lines may follow, in particular a
    comment line containing the creating program version and creation
    date is added bu <i>Xic</i>.  The next line is a CIF comment
    containing the word "PHYSICAL".  This indicates that the following
    cell definition contains physical data.  If this line is not
    found, some time consuming tests are performed to figure out what
    exactly is in the file.

    <p>
    An optional <tt>(RESOLUTION 1000);</tt> comment line follows. 
    This indicates that coordinates in the physical part of the file
    use 1000 units per micron.  If this line is not present, 100 units
    per micron is assumed.  This was the default for early versions of
    <i>Xic</i>, and follows from the implicit CIF assumption.  The use
    of resolutions other than 100 represents an extension of the CIF
    syntax.

    <p>
    The integer following "<tt>RESOLUTION</tt>" can be 100 or any of
    the values supported for the <a
    href="DatabaseResolution"><b>DatabaseResolution</b></a> variable,
    for the physical cell.  For the electrical cell, only the values
    100 and 1000 are allowed.

    <p>
    The electrical part of the file is optional, and starts with a CIF
    comment containing the word "ELECTRICAL", followed by the
    resolution comment and the electrical cell description.  Either
    cell description can be empty, i.e., a <tt>DS 0 1 1;</tt> line
    followed by <tt>DF;</tt> and <tt>E</tt>.  Finally, if the cell was
    written in schematic mode an is a top-level cell (containing no
    terminal nodes) a SPICE listing of the circuit is added to the
    bottom of the cell file.  Such files can be read directly into the
    <i>WRspice</i> program for simulation.  The SPICE listing has no
    relevance to <i>Xic</i>.

    <p>
    In release 3.1.5 and later, the terminating line of a native cell
    file can have "<tt>n</tt>" or "<tt>nd</tt>" (case insensitive)
    following the "<tt>E</tt>", as in normal CIF.  In earlier
    releases, anything after "<tt>E</tt>" would cause a syntax error.

    <p>
    The format of the Physical cell data adheres to the extended CIF
    described in the preceding sections.  Electrical cell descriptions
    use the same extensions, however the array extension never
    appears, as arrays are not available in electrical mode.  The
    major difference in the files is the large number of properties
    assigned in electrical mode.

    <p>
    The Computer Graphics eXchange (CGX) format is a simple binary
    data format somewhat similar to GDSII, but designed to be more
    compact.  Like GDSII, files consist of a sequential list of
    variable-length records.  It has simplified record structure, but
    extensions in data flexibility.  If is more compact than GDSII and
    is more efficient to read and write.

    <p>
    The advantages of CGX are smaller files and faster read/write than
    GDSII.  This format was developed by Whiteley Research Inc., but
    is hereby placed in the public domain without restriction.

    <p>
    The file extension is "<tt>.cgx</tt>".  Gzipped files
    ("<tt>.cgx.gz</tt>") are supported.  <i>Xic</i> will automatically
    identify this file type, and can read, write, and convert to
    <i>Xic</i> files just as GDSII.

    <a name="ident"></a>
    <h2>CGX Format Identifier</h2>

    The first three bytes of a CGX file are 'c', 'g', and 'x'.  The
    fourth byte is an integer format level.  A parser designed to
    handle a certain level will accept that level and any value lower. 
    Presently, the only existing level is 0, thus this byte should be
    set to 0.

    <a name="dtypes"></a>
    <h2>CGX Data Types</h2>

    CGX uses the same long (4-byte) and short (2-byte) integer formats
    as GDSII, and the same 8-byte floating point format.  These are
    the only numerical data types defined.

    <p>
    A date is stored as 8 bytes, as shown in the following table. 
    These are the same numerical fields as used in GDSII, though the
    format is different (bytes are used where possible, rather than
    shorts).  The third column gives the value in terms of the members
    of the <tt>tm</tt> structure from the C library.

    <blockquote>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><td>short</td> <td>year</td>  <td><tt>tm_year + 1900</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td>byte</td> <td>month</td>  <td><tt>tm_mon + 1</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td>byte</td> <td>day</td>    <td><tt>tm_mday</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td>byte</td> <td>hour</td>   <td><tt>tm_hour</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td>byte</td> <td>minute</td> <td><tt>tm_min</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td>byte</td> <td>second</td> <td><tt>tm_sec</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td>byte</td> <td>0</td>      <td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Strings are stored in the same manner as in GDSII.  The null
    terminator in not written, however a null byte will be added to
    strings of odd length, so that record sizes are always even.

    <a name="records"></a>
    <h2>CGX Data Records</h2>

    The four-byte file header is followed by any number of data
    records, the last of which signals the end of data.  There are 11
    defined record types.  Each record begins with a 4-byte header:

    <blockquote>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><td>short</td> <td><tt>recsize</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td>byte </td> <td><tt>rectype</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td>byte </td> <td><tt>flags</tt></td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The <tt>recsize</tt> field is a short unsigned integer giving the
    total record size, including the header.  Thus, as in GDSII,
    records are limited to 64K bytes in length.  The record size will
    always be an even number.  The <tt>rectype</tt> byte is set to a
    small integer to define the type of record.  The <tt>flags</tt>
    byte is used in some of the record types, otherwise it is ignored.

    <p>
    The defined record types are given in the table below.

    <blockquote>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th><tt>rectype</tt></th> <th>name</th></tr>
    <tr><td>0</td> <td><b>LIBRARY</b></td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td> <td><b>STRUCT</b></td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td> <td><b>CPRPTY</b></td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td> <td><b>PROPERTY</b></td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td> <td><b>LAYER</b></td></tr>
    <tr><td>5</td> <td><b>BOX</b></td></tr>
    <tr><td>6</td> <td><b>POLY</b></td></tr>
    <tr><td>7</td> <td><b>WIRE</b></td></tr>
    <tr><td>8</td> <td><b>TEXT</b></td></tr>
    <tr><td>9</td> <td><b>SREF</b></td></tr>
    <tr><td>10</td> <td><b>ENDLIB</b></td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    It is allowable to define additional record types for local or
    proprietary purposes.  If a parser encounters an unknown record
    type, it may skip over the record, ignoring it.

    <a name="library"></a>
    <h4>LIBRARY record</h4>

    The <b>LIBRARY</b> record should be the first data record in the
    file, and can appear once only.

    <p>
    The <tt>flags</tt> byte of the record header can be used for a
    version number, which identifies in some way the remaining data in
    the file.

    <p>
    The <b>LIBRARY</b> record contains the following fields:

    <blockquote>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th>bytes</th> <th>field name</th> <th>purpose</th></tr>
    <tr><td>8</td> <td><i>munit</i></td> <td>machine units</td></tr>
    <tr><td>8</td> <td><i>uunit</i></td> <td>user units</td></tr>
    <tr><td>8</td> <td><i>cdate</i></td> <td>library creation date</td></tr>
    <tr><td>8</td> <td><i>mdate</i></td> <td>library modification
     date</td></tr>
    <tr><td>?</td> <td><i>libname</i></td> <td>library name string</td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The first two fields are double-precision numbers that define the
    scale factors for the data in the file.  These are interpreted in
    the same way as the similar fields in the header of a GDSII file.

    <p>
    The second two fields represent creation and modification dates
    for the file content.

    <p>
    A name string for the library follows.  Strings are null-byte
    terminated, and an additional null byte is added if necessary so
    that the total length is even.

    <a name="struct"></a>
    <h4>STRUCT record</h4>

    The <b>STRUCT</b> record opens a cell structure.  Records that
    follow will be assigned to that cell, until another <b>STRUCT</b>
    record is seen.

    <p>
    The header <tt>flags</tt> byte is not used.

    <p>
    The <b>STRUCT</b> record contains the following fields:

    <blockquote>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th>bytes</th> <th>field name</th> <th>purpose</th></tr>
    <tr><td>8</td> <td><i>cdate</i></td> <td>creation date</td></tr>
    <tr><td>8</td> <td><i>mdate</i></td> <td>modification date</td></tr>
    <tr><td>?</td> <td><i>strname</i></td> <td>structure name string</td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The first two fields provide creation and modification dates for
    the structure.  These are followed by a string giving a name for
    the structure.  This name should be unique in the file.

    <a name="cprpty"></a>
    <h4>CPRPTY record</h4>

    Zero or more <b>CPRPTY</b> records can appear following a
    <b>STRUCT</b> record.  These are properties that are applied to
    the cell.

    <p>
    The header <tt>flags</tt> byte is not used.

    <p>
    The <b>CPRPTY</b> record contains the following fields:

    <blockquote>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th>bytes</th> <th>field name</th> <th>purpose</th></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td> <td><i>number</i></td> <td>property number</td></tr>
    <tr><td>?</td> <td><i>string</i></td> <td>property string</td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Any number or string is allowed.

    <a name="property"></a>
    <h4>PROPERTY record</h4>

    Zero or more <b>PROPERTY</b> records can appear ahead of
    <b>BOX</b>, <b>POLY</b>, <b>WIRE</b>, <b>TEXT</b>, and <b>SREF</b>
    records.  It assigns a property to the object that follows.

    <p>
    The header <tt>flags</tt> byte is not used.

    <p>
    The <b>PROPERTY</b> record contains the following fields:

    <blockquote>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th>bytes</th> <th>field name</th> <th>purpose</th></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td> <td><i>number</i></td> <td>property number</td></tr>
    <tr><td>?</td> <td><i>string</i></td> <td>property string</td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Any number or string is allowed.

    <a name="layer"></a>
    <h4>LAYER record</h4>

    A <b>LAYER</b> record can appear after a <b>STRUCT</b>, and must
    appear before any of <b>BOX</b>, <b>POLY</b>, <b>WIRE</b>,
    <b>TEXT</b> in the <b>STRUCT</b>.  The layer context will persist
    until the next <b>LAYER</b> or <b>STRUCT</b> record.

    <p>
    The header <tt>flags</tt> byte is not used.

    <p>
    The <b>LAYER</b> record contains the following fields:

    <blockquote>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th>bytes</th> <th>field name</th> <th>purpose</th></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td> <td><i>number</i></td>   <td>layer number</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td> <td><i>datatype</i></td> <td>data type</td></tr>
    <tr><td>?</td> <td>[<i>lname</i>]</td>  <td>optional layer name</td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The layer number and data type are sufficient, and have the same
    interpretation as in GDSII.  Alternatively or in addition, a
    string giving a layer name can be supplied.

    <a name="box"></a>
    <h4>BOX record</h4>

    A <b>BOX</b> record can appear after a <b>LAYER</b> record has
    been issued.  The <b>BOX</b> record defines one or more
    rectangular data objects.

    <p>
    The header <tt>flags</tt> byte is not used.

    <p>
    The <b>BOX</b> record contains the following fields:

    <blockquote>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th>bytes</th> <th>field name</th> <th>purpose</th></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td> <td><i>left</i></td>    <td>left value</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td> <td><i>bottom</i></td>  <td>bottom value</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td> <td><i>right</i></td>   <td>right value</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td> <td><i>top</i></td>     <td>top value</td></tr>
    <tr><td>?</td> <td>[<i>repeat</i>]</td><td>repeat for multiple
     boxes</td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The first four integers define a box, and a record can contain
    multiple box definitions (four integers per box).  Each box is
    given the properties currently in effect, and is assigned to the
    layer currently in effect.

    <a name="poly"></a>
    <h4>POLY record</h4>

    A <b>POLY</b> record can appear after a <b>LAYER</b> record has
    been issued.  The <b>POLY</b> record defines a polygon object.

    <p>
    The header <tt>flags</tt> byte is not used.

    <p>
    The <b>POLY</b> record contains the following fields:

    <blockquote>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th>bytes</th> <th>field name</th> <th>purpose</th></tr>
    <tr><td>?</td> <td><i>xy</i></td> <td>coordinate pairs, path must be
     closed</td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Coordinates use four-byte integers.  The first and last coordinate
    pair (x-y values) must be the same.  There must be at least four
    coordinate pairs.

    <a name="wire"></a>
    <h4>WIRE record</h4>

    A <b>WIRE</b> record can appear after a <b>LAYER</b> record has
    been issued.  A <b>WIRE</b> record specifies a single wire (path)
    data object.

    <p>
    The header <tt>flags</tt> field contains a value in the range 0-2
    which sets the end style of the wire:

    <blockquote>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><td>0</td> <td>flush ends</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td> <td>rounded ends</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td> <td>extended square ends</td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    This is the same as the pathtype in GDSII.

    <p>
    The <b>WIRE</b> record contains the following fields:

    <blockquote>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th>bytes</th> <th>field name</th> <th>purpose</th></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td> <td><i>width</i></td> <td>path width</td></tr>
    <tr><td>?</td> <td><i>xy</i></td> <td>coordinate pairs (1 pair or
     more)</td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <a name="text"></a>
    <h4>TEXT record</h4>

    A <b>TEXT</b> record can appear after a <b>LAYER</b> record has
    been issued.  A <b>TEXT</b> record specifies a non-physical text
    object.

    <p>
    The header <tt>flags</tt> byte is an orientation code:

    <blockquote>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><td>bits 0-1</td> <td>rotate the text about the anchor<br>
          00 no rotation<br>
          01 90 degrees<br>
          10 180 degrees<br>
          11 270 degrees</td></tr>
    <tr><td>bit 2</td> <td>mirror y after rotation</td></tr>
    <tr><td>bit 3</td> <td>shift rotations to 45, 135, 225, 315
     degrees</td></tr>
    <tr><td>bits 4-5</td> <td>horizontal justification, 00 left,
     01 center, 10,11 right</td></tr>
    <tr><td>bits 6-7</td> <td>vertical justification, 00 bottom,
     01 center, 10,11 top</td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>
    Note that this is identical to the lowest byte of the <i>Xic</i>
    <a href="labelflags">label flags</a>.

    <p>
    The <b>TEXT</b> record contains the following fields:

    <blockquote>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th>bytes</th> <th>field name</th> <th>purpose</th></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td> <td><i>x</i></td>    <td>x position</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td> <td><i>y</i></td>    <td>y position</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td> <td><i>width</i></td><td>field width</td></tr>
    <tr><td>?</td> <td><i>label</i></td><td>label text</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td> <td><i>flags</i></td><td>additional flags</td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The <i>width</i> gives the physical equivalent width of the text. 
    The height is determined by the font used for rendering.

    <p>
    In order to accommodate additional flags, a flags byte is "hidden"
    behind the label text.  The flags byte follows the null byte that
    terminates the text string.  A null byte may be added following
    the flags byte to make the total byte count even.  The flag bits
    are:
    <blockquote>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><td><tt>SHOW</tt></td> <td>0x1</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>HIDE</tt></td> <td>0x2</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>TLEV</tt></td> <td>0x4</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>LIML</tt></td> <td>0x8</td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    These flags are described with the <a
    href="XprpXform"><tt>XprpXform</tt></a> pseudo-property.
    
    <a name="sref"></a>
    <h4>SREF record</h4>

    The <b>SREF</b> record describes an instance, or an array of
    instances. 

    <p>
    The header <tt>flags</tt> byte can have any of the following bits
    set.

    <blockquote>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th>ANGLE   </th><td> 0x1</td></tr>
    <tr><th>MAGN    </th><td> 0x2</td></tr>
    <tr><th>REFLECT </th><td> 0x4</td></tr>
    <tr><th>ARRAY   </th><td> 0x8</td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The <b>SREF</b> record contains the following fields:

    <blockquote>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th>bytes</th> <th>field name</th> <th>purpose</th></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td> <td><i>x</i></td>     <td>x coordinate</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td> <td><i>y</i></td>     <td>y coordinate</td></tr>
    <tr><td>8</td> <td><i>angle</i></td> <td>rotation angle,
     if <b>ANGLE</b> flag only</td></tr>
    <tr><td>8</td> <td><i>magnif</i></td><td>magnification,
     if <b>MAGN</b> flag only</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td> <td><i>cols</i></td>  <td>array columns,
     if <b>ARRAY</b> flag only</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td> <td><i>rows</i></td>  <td>array rows,
     if <b>ARRAY</b> flag only</td></tr>
    <tr><td>16</td> <td><i>xy</i>[4]</td><td>aref points (like GDSII),
     if <b>ARRAY</b> flag only</td></tr>
    <tr><td>?</td> <td><i>sname</i></td> <td>referenced structure
     name</td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    If the <b>ANGLE</b> flag is set, the cell is to be rotated by an
    angle, in degrees, found in the record.  If the <b>MAGN</b> bit is
    set, the cell is scaled by a value found in the record.  If the
    <b>REFLECT</b> bit is set, the instance will be reflected about
    the x-axis, as in GDSII.  If the <b>ARRAY</b> bit is set, the
    instance is arrayed, as in GDSII, where x, y, and xy give the
    three orientation points, as in a GDSII AREF record.  Unless the
    corresponding bit is set, the corresponding data are not in the
    record.

    <h4>ENDLIB record</h4>

    The <b>ENDLIB</b> record must be the last record of the file.  It
    contains no data.

    <p>
    As integrated circuit mask layouts inexorably increase in
    complexity, the fundamental limitations of the industry standard
    GDSII file format have become a bottleneck.  A major weakness of
    the GDSII format is inefficient data representation, which leads
    to very large files.  File sizes of tens of gigabytes are not
    uncommon, leading to difficulties in transmission, data integrity,
    and consumption of hardware resources.

    <p>
    The Open Artwork System Interchange Standard (OASIS) was designed
    by the <a href="http://www.semi.org">SEMI</a> consortium as a
    modern alternative to the GDSII standard.  A <a
    href="http://wrcad.com/oasis/oasis-3626-042303-draft.pdf">draft
    specification</a> (SEMI Document 3626 2003/04/23) of the OASIS
    format standard was circulated, and subsequently adopted with very
    minor changes (SEMI P39-1105).  The final standard document is
    available from the SEMI organization.

    <p>
    The main objective of the OASIS standard is efficient
    representation of mask layout geometry, both in hierarchical and
    flat representations.  The format makes use of a number of
    techniques to this end.

    <ul>
    <li>A compact variable-size integer representation is used.  Along
    with heavy use of offsets, one and two byte integers can be used
    extensively in place of the larger fixed-size integers used in
    other formats.

    <p>
    <li>Extensive use of modal variables greatly reduces repeated
    information.

    <p>
    <li>String and name referencing by number eliminates repetition of
    these data.

    <p>
    <li>A flags byte indicates the presence or absence of certain data
    fields in most records, so that unused or unset values do not need
    to be included in the stream.

    <p>
    <li>Special compact representations for trapezoids and other
    common features save space.

    <p>
    <li>An encoding mechanism for repetitions can be used to
    consolidate arrays of objects.

    <p>
    <li>A data compression mechanism is supported.
    </ul>

    <p>
    As a "typical" example, the sizes in the table below illustrate
    the space-saving capability of the OASIS format.  This lists the
    size of a GDSII file, and the size of the resulting OASIS file as
    converted with <i>Xic</i> with the main available options.

    <h2>OASIS Support in <i>Xic</i></h2>

    <i>Xic</i> was the first (to our knowledge) commercial
    implementation of the OASIS format.  Some limited tools have been
    made available from Mentor Graphics (GDSII/OASIS translator), and
    SoftJin (GDSII/OASIS translator and text mode converters).  We
    recommend <tt>anuvad</tt> from SoftJin (<a
    href="http://www.softjin.com/html/anuvad.htm">http://www.softjin.com/html/anuvad.htm</a>),
    which has been our "reference" in establishing portability.

    <p>
    This capability was designed from the draft SEMI-3626 document, but
    has incorporated changes from the final specification.

    <p>
    This section describes the OASIS capabilities in <i>Xic</i>.  The
    present status of OASIS support in <i>Xic</i> is complete, the
    bottom line being
    <ol>
    <li><i>Xic</i> can read any spec-conforming OASIS file.
    <li>OASIS output from <i>Xic</i> is readable by any other
        spec-conforming tool.
    <li>Exceptions to the above are <b>bugs</b>, please report!
    </ol>

    <p>
    OASIS is one of the supported <a href="xic:fsaf">archive
    formats</a>, along with GDSII, CIF, and <a
    href="/cgx.html">CGX</a>.  CGX (Computer Graphics eXchange) format
    is another "improved" GDSII developed and placed in the public
    domain by Whiteley Research.  The archive formats have the
    following capabilities in <i>Xic</i>:

    <ul>
    <li>Files can be read directly into <i>Xic</i>, either using the
    <a href="xic:open"><b>Open</b></a> command, or with similar
    buttons and functions in <i>Xic</i>.

    <p>
    <li>Files can be converted directly to another (or the same)
    archive format, or to <i>Xic</i> native cell files, from the <a
    href="xic:convt"><b>Format Conversion</b></a> function in the <a
    href="xic:cvrtmenu"><b>Convert Menu</b></a>.  While converting,
    scaling, windowing (clipped or not) and flattening can be
    employed.  There is also provision for selecting the layers to
    convert.

    <p>
    <li><i>Xic</i> can output a hierarchy in memory to any of the
    archive formats.  The default format is the format of origin, if
    any.

    <p>
    <li>The random access of cells from the file, such as with the
    <b>Contents</b> function of the <a href="xic:files"><b>Files
    Listing</b></a> or the library access mechanism applies to all
    archive formats.

    <p>
    <li>The <a href="xic:hier">Cell Hierarchy Digest</a> (CHD) and <a
    href="xic:geom">Cell Geometry Digest</a> (CGD) features, which
    facilitate working with very large files (too large to fit into
    the main memory database) apply to all archive formats.

    <p>
    <li>The script function that splits a file spatially into pieces,
    <a href="ChdWriteSplit"><tt>ChdWriteSplit</tt></a> applies to all
    archive formats for both input and output.
    </ul>

    <a name="char"></a>
    <h2>Characteristics of OASIS Output From <i>Xic</i></h2>

    The basic OASIS file generated by <i>Xic</i> has the
    characteristics listed below.

    <ul>
    <li>By default, all strings are saved locally as strings, i.e., no
    indirection is used, so there are no &#60;name> records.  This can
    be changed with the <a
    href="OasWriteNameTab"><b>OasWriteNameTab</b></a> variable which
    is connected to <b>Use string tables</b> check boxes in the <a
    href="xic:convt"><b>Format Conversion</b></a> and <a
    href="xic:exprt"><b>Export Control</b></a> panels.

    <p>
    <li>By default, no REPETITION records are generated for
    &#60;geometry> records.  If the <a
    href="OasWriteRep"><b>OasWriteRep</b></a> variable or the
    corresponding check box is set, REPETITION record types may be
    generated.  This option attempts to recognize arrays of identical
    objects when writing OASIS files.

    <p>
    <li>By default, three and four-sided polygons will be written as
    TRAPEZOID or CTRAPEZOID records, however this can be disabled with
    the <a href="OasWriteNoTrapezoids"><b>OasWriteNoTrapezoids</b></a>
    variable.

    <p>
    <li>By default, wires (paths) will retain that data type. 
    However, rectangular two-vertex paths will be converted to a more
    compact rectangle representation if <a
    href="OasWriteWireToBox"><b>OasWriteWireToBox</b></a> is set.

    <p>
    <li>The following record types are not generated by <i>Xic</i>: 
    CIRCLE, XNAME, XELEMENT, XGEOMETRY.

    <p>
    <li> When writing OASIS files with <a
    href="StripForExport"><b>StripForExport</b></a> set, i.e., writing
    physical data only, and when using string tables, the offset table
    is placed in the END record.  With <b>StripForExport</b> not set,
    in general we write two sequential OASIS databases into the file,
    the first for physical data, the second for electrical.  This is a
    <i>Xic</i>-specific extension.  In this case, string tables are
    used in the physical part only, and the offset table is placed in
    the START record.  PAD records are added to avoid overwriting data
    since this is a non-sequential operation.  In all cases,
    strict-mode tables are used.

    <p>
    Note:  If a design contains physical data only, the electrical records
    are absent, so that the file becomes conventional.  Even if electrical
    records are present, the reader will probably ignore them (as does
    <tt>anuvad-0.2</tt>).  However, when exporting physical data, for
    portability <b>StripForExport</b> should always be set.

    <p>
    The string tables themselves are written just ahead of the END
    record in all cases (when tables are used).

    <p>
    <li>OASIS files generated by <i>Xic</i> release 3.2.2 and later
    have a file property named "XIC_SOURCE", with no content.  This
    identifies the file as originating from <i>Xic</i> or a derivative.

    <p>
    <li>All integer values are 32-bit limited, except for values that
    represent offsets into the file, which may be 64-bit.

    <p>
    <li>The OASIS format does not provide a native code to indicate a
    rounded-end wire.  For wires that have rounded ends, i.e., that
    originated as GDSII PATHTYPE=1, the half-width extension is
    specified, and the PATH record is given an empty (info byte = 0x4)
    property named "XIC_ROUNDED_END".

    <p>
    <li>The OASIS format does not provide codes for TEXT element
    presentation.  In <i>Xic</i>, these are used for on-screen labels,
    and are treated by <i>Xic</i> as any other database object, but
    they will not appear on the mask layout.  Thus, at least for
    <i>Xic</i> internal use, TEXT presentation attributes are
    important.  They are stored in a property applied to TEXT records
    named "XIC_LABEL".  The XIC_LABEL property contains two unsigned
    integers.  The first is the width of the label, in database units. 
    The second is the <a href="labelflags">label flags</a> word used
    by <i>Xic</i> which specifies many presentation attributes.

    <p>
    <li>OASIS text labels can contain only printable ASCII characters
    and the space character, thus some trickery is used to support
    multi-line labels.  In OASIS files generated from <i>Xic</i>, the
    following non-printing characters are replaced with the indicated
    character sequence when encountered in label text:
    <blockquote>
    <table border=0>
    <tr><td><tt>0xa</tt> (line feed)</td> <td><tt>"\n"</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>0xd</tt> (carriage return)</td> <td><tt>"\r"</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>0x9</tt> (tab)</td> <td><tt>"\t"</tt></td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The OASIS reader will perform the reverse conversion, if the
    XIC_SOURCE property is found in the file, meaning that it was
    written by <i>Xic</i>.

    <p>
    <li>All other properties, which might be given to CELL or
    &#60;geometry> records, are named "XIC_PROPERTY" and consist of
    concatenated number/string pairs.  <i>Xic</i> uses properties
    indexed by a number, with string-type data, so that the
    XIC_PROPERTY consists of the list of properties as known to
    <i>Xic</i> for that cell or object.
    </ul>

    <p>
    There are several options in <i>Xic</i> that modify OASIS
    input/output.  Many of these can be controlled by check boxes in
    the <b>OASIS</b> page in the <a href="xic:exprt"><b>Export
    Control</b></a> and <a href="xic:convt"><b>Format
    Conversion</b></a> panels from the <a
    href="xic:cvrtmenu"><b>Convert Menu</b></a>, which reflect the
    status of the variables (which can also be set with the
    <b>!set</b> command or equivalent). 

    <blockquote>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th colspan=2><a href="!set:cvimport">Convert Menu - Input and ASCII Output</a></th></tr>
    <tr><td><b>OasReadNoChecksum</b></td><td>Ignore checksum in OASIS input file</td></tr>

    <tr><td><b>OasWriteChecksum</b></td><td>Compute and add checksum to OASIS output</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>OasWriteNoTrapezoids</b></td><td>Don't convert polys to trapezoids</td></tr>

    <h2>Requirements And Limitations for Reading OASIS</h2>

    <i>Xic</i> can very likely read any OASIS file that meets the
    published specification.  Exceptions should be reported as bugs!

    <ul>
    <li>
    Properties are ignored, unless the name matches one of those
    understood by <i>Xic</i> (see above).  The file properties set an
    internal variable but otherwise do nothing.

    <p>
    <li>
    The XNAME, XELEMENT, and XGEOMETRY records are ignored.

    <p>
    <li>
    The CIRCLE record will create a polygon object approximating a circle,
    with the number of sides using the internal variable in <i>Xic</i>.

    <p>
    <li>
    The TRAPEZOID and CTRAPEZOID records will create a polygon object.

    <p>
    <li>The REPETITION records found in PLACEMENT records will define a
    cell array if possible (i.e., represents a periodic Manhattan
    configuration), otherwise individual cell instances will be created
    and replicated.  In &#60;geometry> records, any REPETITION is
    accepted, but the repetition is decomposed and separate objects are
    created in memory.

    <p>
    Library files are <i>Xic</i> input files which contain references
    to cells, other libraries, or cell definitions.  The format of a
    library file is as follows:

    <blockquote>
    (<tt>Library</tt> <i>libname</i>);<br>
    <tt>#</tt> <i>any comments</i><br>
    <br>
    <tt>#</tt> <i>optional keywords to implement conditional flow</i><br>

    <i>symbol definition</i><br>
    <tt>E</tt><br>
    ...
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The first line must begin with "<tt>(Library</tt> ", which
    designates a library file to <i>Xic</i>.  The <i>libname</i> on
    this line following <tt>Library</tt> is ignored, but by convention
    is the library file name.  Within the file are three kinds of data
    fields:  properties, references, and cells.  Any line starting
    with a pound sign ('#') is taken as a comment and ignored.  Blank
    lines are ignored.

    <p>
    It is recommended that library files be given a "<tt>.lib</tt>"
    extension.  This is not a strict requirement, except that the
    listing of libraries from the search path provided in the <a
    href="xic:libs"><b>Libraries List</b></a> button in the <a
    href="xic:filemenu"><b>File Menu</b></a> will contain only files
    with this extension.

    <p>
    All library files (including the device library) support a limited
    macro capability.  The macro capability makes use of the generic
    <a href="macro">macro preprocessor</a> provided in <i>Xic</i>. 
    The reader should refer to this section for a full description of
    the preprocessor capabilities.  The preprocessor provides a few
    predefined macros used for testing (and customizing for) release
    number, operating system, etc.  The keyword names, which
    correspond to the generic names as described for the macro
    preprocessor, are case-insensitive and listed in the following
    table.

    <p>
    These can be used to conditionally determine which parts of the
    file are actually loaded when the library is read.  Presently,
    there is no macro expansion or text substitution in lines of text
    in the library, the macros simply implement flow control. 
    Otherwise, they work the same as similar keywords in the <a
    href="techfile:macros">technology file</a> and in <a
    href="scr:preproc">scripts</a>, and are reminiscent of the
    preprocessor directives in the C/C++ programming language.

    <p>
    Properties are used in the <a href="devlib">device library</a>
    file (which is a special library file which must exist in order to
    use electrical mode), and are described in the description of the
    device library file format.

    <p>
    Aliases provide alternative names by which data records can be
    obtained from the library.  In particular, for the device
    library, this facilitates accessing library devices under
    alternative names.  For example, in older device libraries, the
    terminal device was named "<tt>vcc</tt>", while the present name
    of a similar terminal is "<tt>tbar</tt>".  The addition of

    <blockquote>
    <tt>Alias vcc tbar</tt>
    </blockquote>

    will satisfy references to the <tt>vcc</tt> terminal device in
    older designs.

    <p>
    References associate a name with a cell, or another library.  For
    a cell, <i>name</i> (above) is the name by which the cell will be
    added to the database when opened, and the name that will appear
    in selection listings.  The <i>path</i> is a path to the file
    containing the cell, which can be native (Xic), or a path to an <a
    href="xic:fsaf">archive file</a> containing the cell.  If the path
    contains white space characters, it should be single or double
    quoted.

    <p>
    Aliases may be used to provide alternative names.

    <p>
    If the path points to an archive file, the <i>cellname</i>
    argument can be set to the name of the cell in the file.  Note
    that this does not have to be the same as <i>name</i>.  Opening
    <i>name</i> will open the cell referenced and add it to the
    database as <i>name</i>.  Any subcells that have references in the
    same library file will be opened under the library reference name. 
    All other cell name <a href="cellname">aliasing</a> is suppressed,
    except for <a href="AutoRename">AutoRename</a>.

    <p>
    If <i>cellname</i> is not given, opening a reference to an archive
    file with multiple cells will cause a pop-up to appear, allowing
    the user to choose which cell to open.  In this case, the cell
    will be opened under its own name.
 
    <p>
    If <i>path</i> points to another library file, then
    <i>cellname</i>, if given, indicates which reference in the
    library to open, i.e., it should be one of the <i>name</i>s in the
    referenced library.  In this case, the cell will be opened as
    <i>name</i> in the original library.  If <i>cellname</i> is not
    given, a pop-up will appear allowing the user to choose which
    library element in the referenced library to open.  A cell
    selected in this way will be opened as <i>name</i> in the
    referenced library.  Thus the <tt>Reference</tt> keyword provides
    a means for multiple-level indirection through the library files.

    <p>
    The <tt>Directory</tt> keyword is followed by a full path to a
    directory.  Every layout or library file found in the directory is
    logically added as a <tt>Reference</tt>, but with no
    <i>cellname</i> given.  This keyword provides an easy way to
    reference a collection of cell files, for example.

    <p>
    Cells can be defined within libraries by including the
    native-format body in the library file.  The first line of the
    cell must start with "<tt>(Symbol</tt> ".  The symbol text should
    contain both the electrical and physical blocks.  The cells in the
    device library file are special in that they contain only an
    electrical block, so are not representative.  Cells can be added
    to a library with a text editor, by copying from native cell
    files.  The name of the cell is actually given by the lines with
    format like "<tt>9</tt> <i>symbolname</i>;" and the
    <i>symbolname</i> in the "<tt>(Symbol</tt>
    <i>symbolname</i><tt>);</tt>" is actually ignored.  The user need
    not concern themselves with details of the format, it is
    sufficient to simply copy the entire <i>Xic</i> cell file into the
    library, however any trailing SPICE listing should be excluded,
    including the "<tt>* Generated by Xic</tt>..." line.

    <h2>Example Library File</h2>

    The example below uses the <tt>Reference</tt> directive only, which
    is common.  It illustrates some of the types of references that are
    possible.

    <p>
    The device library file is a special <a href="libraries">library
    file</a> which contains all of the information required to render
    and otherwise support the devices available in the electrical mode
    of <i>Xic</i>.  It is expected to be found along the library <a
    href="xicpaths">search path</a>.  The search is always performed
    in the current directory first, whether or not this is indicated
    by the search path.  The default name for this file is
    "<tt>device.lib</tt>", however this name can be changed with the
    <tt>DeviceLibrary</tt> keyword in the <a
    href="techfile">technology file</a>.  Only one device library is
    used, and the first file found in the search path with a matching
    name is read.

    <p>
    In present <i>Xic</i> releases, devices are not required to be
    supplied in the device library, however only devices referenced in
    the library will appear in the device selection menus.  When
    loading a design produced in Virtuoso, for example, the schematic
    symbols are imported as cells which function as devices, but are
    not automatically included in any device library.  As long as
    <i>Xic</i> can find these device cells when the layout file is
    loaded, all is well.  This is automatic if the device cells are
    kept in the layout files, which is true by default.  However, the
    device cells can be added to the device library in various ways,
    as described below.  This has the following advantages:

    <ol>
    <li>The devices are available in the <a href="xic:devs">device
    menus</a> available from the side menu in electrical mode.  This
    facilitates use of the device in other designs.

    <li>The devices are no longer included in the layout files,
    reducing their size.  However, the library must be provided along
    with the files when exporting the design.
    </ol>

    <p>
    Devices can be either primitive devices as used by SPICE, or
    subcircuit macros.  If the device represents a subcircuit macro,
    the name of the subcircuit is given as a <a
    href="prpty:model"><b>model</b> property</a>, and that subcircuit
    must exist in one of the <a href="modlib">model library</a> files. 
    For example, a device named "opamp" could be added to the device
    library file.  Then the user would set the <tt>model</tt> property
    to something like "ua741" which would have a subcircuit definition
    somewhere in the model library files (perhaps in a directory
    containing SPICE models obtained from a semiconductor
    manufacturer).

    <p>
    There are four classes of device that may appear in the device
    library file.  The first class consists of basic elements such as
    resistors, capacitors, and semiconductor devices which have
    physical implementations in a layout and are known elements in
    SPICE.  The second class consists of voltage and current sources,
    which are known elements in SPICE but do not have physical
    equivalents in a layout.  The third class applies to macros,
    which expand to a subcircuit in SPICE.  These may or may not have
    an actual physical embodiment.  The fourth class are terminals,
    which are used in the electrical schematic to provide
    connections.  These are not used in SPICE, but are used to
    establish connectivity when producing SPICE input.  They have no
    direct physical implementation, but imply physical connections.

    <p>
    The first line of the file must be in the form
    <blockquote>
      (<tt>Library</tt> <i>filename</i>);</tt>
    </blockquote>
    This is the signature used in all library files.

    <p>
    Comment lines, which are ignored when the file is parsed, begin
    with the '#' character, and can appear anywhere outside of the
    device definitions except on the first line.  Lines containing
    only white space are ignored.

    <a name="gprop"></a>
    <h2>Device Library Global Properties</h2>

    <p>
    The device library file handles "global properties".  These
    properties appear at the beginning of the file, after the initial
    line but before the definitions.  The syntax is
    <blockquote>
      <tt>Property</tt> <i>identifier string</i>
    </blockquote>
    where <tt>Property</tt> appears literally, <i>identifier</i> is a
    keyword or equivalent integer as described below, and the rest of
    the line constitutes the <i>string</i>.  There can be any number
    of these lines.

    The following properties are recognized:

    <a name="SpiceDotSave"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SpiceDotSave</b><dd>
    This property is identified by the keyword "<tt>SpiceDotSave</tt>"
    or by the integer 20.

    <p>
    The <i>string</i> consists of a SPICE key letter for a device
    (such as '<tt>R</tt>' for a resistor), followed by the name of a
    parameter known to SPICE for that device.  While a SPICE deck is
    being created, and if this property was given, each device in the
    circuit that is keyed by that letter will trigger the addition of
    a line in the SPICE file in the form
    <blockquote>
    <tt>.save @</tt><i>name</i>[<i>param</i>]
    </blockquote>
    The <i>name</i> is the name of the device, and the <i>param</i> is
    the parameter name given in the property.  This construct forms a
    vector name which the directive ensures will be saved during
    simulation, and thus be available for output.  This is the means
    by which device parameter data are made available <i>by
    default</i> in SPICE runs initiated from SPICE output generated by
    <i>Xic</i>.  <i>WRspice</i> and other SPICE3-derivative simulators
    will recognize this form, however only <i>WRspice</i> will
    actually save the vector in interactive mode.  SPICE3 ignores
    <tt>.save</tt> lines, except in batch mode.

    <p>
    This property is used in the supplied <tt>device.lib</tt> file,
    for current sources and the "<tt>c</tt>" (current) parameter.  The
    <b>branch</b> property for current sources references
    "<tt>@</tt><i>name</i><tt>[c]</tt>", so that it is important to
    ensure that this vector is saved.  Thus, the appropriate global
    property is
    <blockquote>
      <tt>Property SpiceDotSave I c</tt><br>
      or equivalently<br>
      <tt>Property 20 I c</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    This will produce lines in the SPICE output like
    <blockquote>
      <tt>.save @isource[c]</tt>
    </blockquote>
    for a current source named <tt>isource</tt>.
    </dl>

    <a name="DefaultNode"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>DefaultNode</b><dd>
    This property is identified by the keyword "<tt>DefaultNode</tt>"
    or by the integer 21.

    <p>
    This property is used for providing a default node name for the
    last node listed in a SPICE output device line.  This allows the
    use of a three-node MOS device, with the substrate node connected
    automatically.  The feature is enabled by adding the following
    property line at the top of the device library file:

    <blockquote>
      <tt>Property DefaultNode</tt> <i>device_name num_nodes node_name</i><br>
      or equivalently<br>
      <tt>Property 21</tt> <i>device_name num_nodes node_name</i><br>
    </blockquote>

    The parameters are:
    <table border=0>
    <tr><td><i>device_name</i></td>
     <td>name of device (e.g., <tt>nmos</tt>)</tr></td>
    <tr><td><i>num_nodes</i></td>
     <td>number of nodes expected by SPICE</tr></td>
    <tr><td><i>node_name</i></td>
     <td>name of node to be added</tr></td>
    </table>

    <p>
    For example,

    <blockquote>
      <tt>Property DefaultNode nmos 4 NSUB</tt>
    </blockquote>
  
    <p>
    A <tt>Property</tt> line should be added for each device which has
    a default node.  The respective device descriptions in the
    device library file should also be modified to remove the
    substrate mode.  The supplied <tt>device.lib</tt> file contains
    MOS models with this feature included, and also standard models.
  
    <p>
    Using the example above, a SPICE output deck will contain lines like

    <blockquote>
      <tt>M1 1 2 3 NSUB</tt> ...
    </blockquote>

    Also, there will be a line added at the top of the deck:

    <blockquote>
      <tt>.global NSUB</tt>
    </blockquote>

    This line tells <i>WRspice</i> to not modify this node during
    subcircuit expansion.  The user must explicitly add a connection
    to the global node, usually to a voltage source.  This is
    accomplished in <i>Xic</i> by placing a terminal device, and
    modifying the terminal name to the node name (NSUB).
    </dl>

    <a name="devlib:DeviceKey"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>DeviceKey</b><dd>
    This property is identified by the keyword "<tt>DeviceKey</tt>"
    or by the integer 22.

    <p>
    <font color=red>
    Although still recognized, this property is obsolete and should not
    be used.  The <b>DeviceKeyV2</b> property syould be used instead.
    </font>

    <p>
    There is an internal table of mappings from letters to devices, in
    accordance with the definitions and traditions of SPICE.  For
    example, '<tt>r</tt>' (case insensitive) maps to a resistor
    device.  It is possible to define new device keys, overriding the
    defaults.  It is also possible to define multi-letter keys.

    <p>
    These keys apply when <i>Xic</i> reads a SPICE file and maps
    devices to those found in the <tt>device.lib</tt> file.

    <p>
    The format for the property specification is
    <blockquote>
    <tt>Property DeviceKey</tt> <i>prefix opt val nnodes nname pname</i><br>
    or equivalently<br>
    <tt>Property 22</tt> <i>prefix opt val nnodes nname pname</i>
    </blockquote>

    <dl>
    <dt><i>prefix</i><dd>
    This is a short (usually single-character) device identification prefix,
    the first character if which must be a letter.
    <dt><i>opt</i><dd>
    This is a binary value, the token can be <tt>0</tt>, <tt>no</tt>, or
    <tt>off</tt> if unset, or <tt>1</tt>, <tt>yes</tt>, or <tt>on</tt> if
    set.  If set, then the presence of the last connection node of the
    device is optional (such as for a BJT, which has an optional substrate
    node).
    <dt><i>val</i><dd>
    This is a binary value as above.  If set, text following the nodes
    is saved in a <b>value</b> property and the <b>model</b> property
    is unset, as for voltage/current source devices.
    <dt><i>nnodes</i><dd>
    An integer giving the number of device nodes, including the optional
    node if any.
    <dt><i>nname</i><dd>
    The device name, or the n-type device, in the library.
    <dt><i>pname</i><dd>
    If this is not 0 or missing, it is the name of the p-type library
    device.
    </dl>
    </dl>

    <a name="devlib:DeviceKeyV2"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>DeviceKeyV2</b><dd>
    This property is identified by the keyword "<tt>DeviceKeyV2</tt>"
    or by the integer 23.

    <p>
    This is an extended version of the now-obsolete <b>DeviceKey</b>
    property that supports current-controlled sources and switch, and
    will allow any number of optional nodes.  The older format is still
    recognized, but can not be used to create standard keys for these
    devices.

    <p>
    The format for the property specification is
    <blockquote>
    <tt>Property DeviceKeyV2</tt> <i>prefix min max devs val nnodes nname
    pname</i><br>
    or equivalently<br>
    <tt>Property 23</tt> <i>prefix min max devs val nnodes nname pname</i>
    </blockquote>

    <dl>
    <dt><i>prefix</i><dd>
    This is a short (usually single-character) device identification prefix,
    the first character if which must be a letter.
    <dt><i>min</i><dd>
    This is the minimum number of nodes used by the device.
    <dt><i>max</i><dd>
    This is the maximum number of nodes used by the device.  The difference
    from the <i>min</i> is the number of optional nodes.
    <dt><i>devs</i><dd>
    This is the number of device reference names, which is one for
    current-controlled sources and switch.
    <dt><i>val</i><dd>
    This is a binary value, the token can be <tt>0</tt>, <tt>no</tt>,
    or <tt>off</tt> if unset, or <tt>1</tt>, <tt>yes</tt>, or
    <tt>on</tt> if set.  If set, text following the nodes is saved in
    a <b>value</b> property and the <b>model</b> property is unset, as
    for voltage/current source devices.
    <dt><i>nname</i><dd>
    The device name, or the n-type device, in the library.
    <dt><i>pname</i><dd>
    If this is not 0 or missing, it is the name of the p-type library
    device.
    </dl>

    <p>
    The internal table provides the following defaults.
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">

    <p>
    The user working with MOS technology may need to understand and
    set this property for "<tt>m</tt>" (MOS) devices.  For LVS, is is
    required that the electrical and physical MOS devices assume the
    same number of nodes.  The device library provides a choice of
    three-terminal (<b>nmos</b>, <b>pmos</b>) and four-terminal
    (<b>nmos1</b>, <b>pmos1</b>) devices.  Although either type of
    device can be placed in a schematic that is used for simulation,
    for comparison to the physical layout consistency is required with
    the MOS device extraction templates defined in the technology file
    <a href="ext:deviceblock"><b>Device</b> blocks</a>.

    <p>
    For consistency, there are two choices:
    <ol>
    <li>The technology defines a three-terminal "nmos" device, and the
    schematics exclusively use the <b>nmos</b> schematic symbol
    (similar for pmos).  In this case, substrate/well connectivity is
    simply ignored in comparisons.

    <li>The technology file defines a four-terminal "nmos1" device,
    and the schematics use the <b>nmos1</b> schematic symbol (similar
    for pmos).  In this case, the substrate/well connection at each
    transistor is included in the connectivity comparison.
    </ol>

    <p>
    Three and four terminal devices of the same sex can not be mixed
    in physical extraction, however they can be different for p and n
    devices.  For example, in a process where only the pmos devices
    reside in a defined "tub", it might be convenient to use
    three-terminal nmos devices, and four terminal pmos devices.  In
    this case, the technology file should define extraction devices
    for a three-terminal "nmos", and four terminal "pmos1".  The
    standard <tt>device.lib</tt> file should include the line

    <blockquote>
    <tt>Property DeviceKeyV2 m 4 4 0 false nmos pmos1</tt>
    </blockquote>

    and the user should remember to use the three-terminal <b>nmos</b>
    and four-terminal <b>pmos1</b> library devices exclusively in
    schematics that will be used with physical data.

    <p>
    The <a href="!devkeys"><b>!devkeys</b></a> command dumps the current
    keys to the console window, which can be useful for debugging this
    capability.
    </dl>

    <a name="alias"></a>
    <h2>Device Library Aliases</h2>

    The device library may use the <tt>Alias</tt> keyword

    <blockquote>
    <tt>Alias</tt> <i>alias</i> <i>libcellname</i>
    </blockquote>

    to define alternate names for devices contained in the library. 
    The alternate names can be used equivalently when referencing
    devices from the library.  Aliases, however, will <b>not</b>
    appear in the <a href="xic:devs">device menu</a> displayed from
    the electrical side menu in <i>Xic</i>.

    <p>
    The <tt>device.lib</tt> file distributed with <i>Xic</i> provides
    aliases to terminal devices whose names have been changed from
    those used in earlier <i>Xic</i> releases, thus providing
    backward compatibility.  The device names were changed in release
    3.2.22.

    <h3>Device Library Devices</h3>

    A device is simply an electrical cell definition.  It is
    distinguished as a device by the presence and values of certain
    properties.  Devices have no subcells or sub-devices, they must
    contain only geometry.  They can not contain physical data.

    <p>
    The supplied <tt>device.lib</tt> file contains a collection or
    rather plain looking generic device models that correspond to the
    devices supported by SPICE.  Additional devices are often created
    when a layout is <a href="cdsimport">imported</a> from Cadence
    Virtuoso.  These correspond to the schematic symbols of devices
    used in Virtuoso schematics.  Devices can be created by the user
    through use of the <a href="xic:sadev"><b>Save As Device</b></a>
    button in the <b>File Menu</b>.  These can be used to supplement
    or replace devices provided in the default library.

    <p>
    Device definitions as native cell definitions, whether inline in
    the <tt>device.lib</tt> file, or in separate files, may or may not
    have an empty <a href="symfilefmt#xicfile">physical part</a>. 
    This is in contrast with normal cells, where a physical part is
    required.  In releases prior to 4.1.12, inline cell definitions
    could not have an empty physical block, but in a cell file the
    empty physical block was required.

    <p>
    Devices can be referenced in three ways:
    <ol>
    <li>By using the <tt>Reference</tt> keyword to reference 
    a cell containing the device definition.

    <li>By using the <tt>Directory</tt> keyword to reference a
    directory that contains device definitions.  This is particularly
    useful as a way to include a user's special devices.  One can
    "install" the device by simply copying it into a directory.

    <li>By including the device definition in the library file as an
    inline cell definition.  This is the format used in the supplied
    <tt>device.lib</tt> file.  In early <i>Xic</i> releases, this was
    the only way to define devices.
    </ol>

    <p>
    The native syntax for device definitions, as used in the supplied
    <tt>device.lib</tt> file, is described below.  This is the same
    CIF-like file format as used in <a href="symfilefmt">native cell
    files</a>.  The syntax as described applies to native-format
    device cell files as well as devices inlined into the
    <tt>device.lib</tt> file.  However, for stand-alone cell
    descriptions, other file formats can be used.

    <p>
    In these cells, there is no physical representation, however an
    empty physical representation can appear.  The default resolution
    is 100 units per micron (as in CIF and native cell files), however
    the <tt>(RESOLUTION 1000);</tt> comment can appear, which
    indicates 1000 units per micron, as in ordinary cells.  Each
    device entry has the following format:

    <blockquote>
      <tt>(Symbol</tt> <i>symname</i><tt>);</tt><br>
      <tt>5</tt> <i>property</i><br>
      <tt>5 ...</tt><br>
      <tt>9</tt> <i>symname</i>;<br>
      <tt>DS 0 1 1;</tt><br>
      <tt>L SCED;</tt><br>
      <i>geometry</i> ...<br>
      <i>more layers/geometry</i> ...<br>
      <tt>DF;</tt><br>
      <tt>E</tt><br>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The first line is a CIF comment stating the device name, e.g., for
    a capacitor one might have
    <blockquote>
    <tt>(Symbol cap);</tt>
    </blockquote>
    This line signals the beginning of a device definition to the
    function that automatically updates the device library file after
    a device is <a href="devedit">edited</a>, so must appear as shown
    for that feature to work correctly.

    <p>
    This is followed by property specification lines, which begin with
    the number '<tt>5</tt>', and a cell name definition, which begins
    with the number '<tt>9</tt>'; The property lines can occur in any
    order.  Technically, the property lines are optional, however the
    name line is mandatory.  All lines in the symbol specification
    parts of the file must end with a semicolon (;), except for the
    symbol termination line "<tt>E</tt>".  While the device is being
    parsed, the ';' is actually taken to be the line terminator, so
    that logical lines can span several printed lines.

    <p>
    The name line begins with '<tt>9</tt>' in the first column,
    followed by the symbol name (space separated), and ending with a
    semicolon (without space).  This line actually defines the name of
    the device, as known to <i>Xic</i>.  The property lines define the
    device terminals and other parameters through the property
    mechanism.  Each line begins with '<tt>5</tt>' in the first
    column, followed by the property number, followed by other data,
    and finally terminated with a semicolon.  Refer to the <a
    href="prptyspec">properties</a> description for information about
    properties and their syntax.  If the device represents a
    subcircuit macro, the <b>name</b> property must be keyed with the
    character '<tt>x</tt>' or '<tt>X</tt>'.

    <p>
    After the property lines comes a CIF define symbol directive:
    <blockquote><tt>
      DS 0 1 1;
    </tt></blockquote>

    <p>
    The next line is a directive to use the SCED layer, which is the
    active layer in the drawing:
    <blockquote><tt>
      L SCED;
    </tt></blockquote>

    <p>
    The drawing in the cell should be on this layer to visually match
    the other elements, however there is no real requirement for this. 
    There are additional layers in the default technology which can be
    used, typically for highlighting.  The geometry used in a device
    has no electrical significance, i.e., no connectivity, and exists
    for visual purposes only.

    <p>
    The devices in the supplied <tt>device.lib</tt> file use 100 units
    per internal "micron" for historical reasons.  Be advised that if
    a <tt>(RESOLUTION 1000);</tt> line appears at the top of the
    device definition, 1000 units will be assumed for the device. 
    Devices that are edited by <i>Xic</i> or added through <i>Xic</i>
    editing will use 1000 units.

    <p>
    After the geometry comes the CIF directive to end symbol definition:
    <blockquote><tt>
      DF;
    </tt></blockquote>

    <p>
    The last line of the device definition contains the single character
    <blockquote><tt>
      E
    </tt></blockquote>
    which indicates the end of the device symbol definition.  Note that
    in this case there is no terminating semicolon.

    <p>
    As an example, here is the default library entry for a resistor:

    <blockquote><tt>
    # resistor<br>
    (Symbol res);<br>
    5 10 -1 0 0 0 + 0 0 0;<br>
    5 10 -1 1 0 -1000 - 0 0 0;<br>
    5 11 R 0;<br>
    5 15 -100 -100 0 -1 "<v>/<value>O";<br>
    9 res;<br>
    DS 0 1 1;<br>
    L SCED;<br>
    W 0 0 -1000 0 -750 -100 -700 100 -600 -100 -500 100 -400 -100 -300 0
     -250 0 0;<br>
    L ETC1;<br>
    W 0 -100 -75 -100 -125;<br>
    W 0 -125 -100 -75 -100;<br>
    DF;<br>
    E
    </tt></blockquote>

    <p>
    The property lines (lines beginning with `5') represent two node
    definitions, a name, and a branch, in that order.  The 'W' line
    (wire) following the SCED layer declaration represents the path
    used to render the resistor schematic symbol.  The other two 'W'
    lines, following the ETC1 layer declaration, represents a '+' mark
    used to distinguish the positive end of the resistor, and the
    target upon which the user clicks to obtain the resistor current,
    in conjunction with the <b>branch</b> property.

    <p>
    The device library file can be viewed or edited from within
    <i>Xic</i> through the <a href="xic:open"><b>Open</b></a> command. 
    If "device.lib" (or the actual file name) is given in response to
    the cell-to-edit prompt, a text editing window displaying the file
    appears.  Actually, the current device library file is first
    copied to the current directory (if it is not already there), and
    the copy is opened for editing.  After saving changes and quitting
    the text editor, the internal device database is rebuilt from the
    device library file in the current directory.

    <p>
    Devices from the library can also be <a href="devedit">edited</a>
    graphically, and devices added, from within <i>Xic</i>.

    <p>
    The terminal device is a special non-physical object used for
    tying different parts of the circuit together without a wire, and
    for assigning node names.  The library can contain multiple,
    functionally equivalent terminal devices under various names,
    each possibly with a different visual style.  The name label of a
    terminal device defaults to the device name, but can be changed
    by editing the label text once placed.  It is important that the
    <b>name</b> property of the device begin with the character
    '<tt>@</tt>'.

    <p>
    In the library, any device that has no <b>name</b> property and
    exactly one <b>node</b> property will be taken as a ground
    terminal device.  A terminal device will also have exactly one
    <b>node</b> property, but must have a <b>name</b> property with a
    name string starting with the '<tt>@</tt>' character.

    <p>
    Devices such as transistors require model specification for
    generation of SPICE simulation input.  <i>Xic</i> has a mechanism
    for handling large numbers of device models, while at the same
    time providing interactive editing capability.  Models for devices
    (<tt>.model</tt> lines) and subcircuits (<tt>.subckt</tt> lines)
    are read from a model library file found along the library <a
    href="xicpaths">search path</a>, and from files found in
    particular subdirectories of the directories in the path.

    <p>
    The first model library file found in the search path is searched
    for models and subcircuits, as are any files found in
    subdirectories with a specified name.  The default name for the
    model library file is "<tt>model.lib</tt>", however another name
    can be specified in the <a href="techfile">technology file</a>
    with the <b>ModelLibrary</b> keyword.  The default name for
    subdirectories to search for device models is "<tt>models</tt>",
    and this name can be changed in the technology file with the
    <b>ModelSubdirs</b> keyword.

    <p>
    <a name="ignore"></a>
    In the search, the current directory is always searched first,
    whether or not this is actually specified in the search path. 
    Only the first model library file is read, which allows the user
    to override a system model library file with a custom version. 
    All files found in <tt>models</tt> subdirectories will be
    searched, unless the directory contains a file names
    "<tt>.xic_ignore</tt>", in which case the files in the directory
    will be ignored.  The names of the files found in <tt>models</tt>
    subdirectories are unimportant, but files existing in these
    directories should contain SPICE models, though it is not an error
    if no models or subcircuits are found in a file.

    <p>
    As with the device library file, the model library file can be
    edited using the <a href="xic:open"><b>Open</b></a> command in
    <i>Xic</i>.  One simply enters the name (e.g.,
    "<tt>model.lib</tt>") when prompted for the cell name to edit.  A
    text editing window appears.  If the file was not found in the
    current directory, it is copied to the current directory. 
    Otherwise, the file in the current directory is copied to a file
    with the same name but with a "<tt>.bak</tt>" extension.  When
    editing is complete and changes saved, the model database is
    rebuilt, using the model library file in the current directory.

    <p>
    The "<tt>models</tt>" subdirectories might be used with large
    collections of files provided by semiconductor manufacturers. 
    Typically, the package supplied from the manufacturer contains a
    number of files, each describing a device sold by the
    manufacturer.  In most cases, all that is required to make these
    models available to <i>Xic</i> is to move the files into a
    <tt>models</tt> subdirectory of a directory in the library path. 
    All of these files found will be added to the database.

    <p>
    The format is that of SPICE, where the first line of each model
    starts with <a href=".model"><tt>.model</tt></a> (case
    insensitive), and the text for that model is assumed to extend to
    the next <tt>.model</tt> or <tt>.subckt</tt> line or end of file.

    <p>
    Subcircuits as well as models are are tabulated.  A subcircuit
    begins with <tt>.subckt</tt>, and ends on a line starting with
    <tt>.ends</tt>.  Models and subcircuits defined within a
    subcircuit are not accessible as separate library references.

    <p>
    Any line which begins with '<tt>#</tt>' or '<tt>*</tt>' is treated
    as a comment and ignored.

    <p>
    The text of any of the files in the <tt>models</tt> subdirectories
    must not change while <i>Xic</i> is active.  If the text changes
    after the time that <i>Xic</i> caches the file offsets to the
    models, the model text that <i>Xic</i> will extract from the file
    will very likely be bogus.  If the model library file is edited
    with the <b>Open</b> command and saved, all offset tables are
    updated.

    <a name="bin"></a>
    <h2>MOS Model Spatial Binning</h2>

    When <i>Xic</i> generates a SPICE netlist, it automatically
    includes the text of the required models.  For MOS devices, i.e.,
    devices keyed by the letter '<tt>m</tt>', a spatial binning model
    selection scheme is available.  This same binning mode is
    available for MOS devices in <i>WRspice</i>.  When running
    <i>WRspice</i> from <i>Xic</i>, the SPICE text is composed by
    <i>Xic</i>, so the it is usually necessary to resolve the spatial
    binning within <i>Xic</i>.

    <p>
    Complete information is available in the description of the
    <i>WRspice</i> <a href="mosmodel">MOS model</a>.

    <p>
    The <tt>L</tt> and <tt>W</tt> parameters values found in the MOS
    device <a href="prpty:param"><b>param</b></a> property are used to
    key different models.  The <a href="prpty:model"><b>model</b></a>
    property specifies the basename of the model.  The variations are
    found in the model library under the basename suffixed with
    "<tt>.1</tt>", "<tt>.2</tt>", etc.  Each of these models may
    contain parameters <tt>LMIN</tt>, <tt>LMAX</tt>, <tt>WMIN</tt>,
    <tt>WMAX</tt> which specify the parameter window for the model. 
    The model with the window containing the device
    <tt>L</tt>/<tt>W</tt> is the one chosen.  If a model is missing
    one of the min/max parameter sets, it will match any value of the
    parameter.

Label Font File Format
!!HTML
    The font used to render text labels in drawing windows is a vector
    font for scalability.  The character maps have internal defaults,
    which should be suitable in most cases, however these can be
    overridden by external definitions from a file.  One can dump the
    current set of character maps to a file with the <b>Dump Vector
    Font</b> button in the <a href="xic:font">font setting</a> panel
    available in the <b>Attributes Menu</b>.  Character maps from this
    file can be modified and placed in a file named "<tt>xic_font</tt>"
    in the library <a href="xicpaths">search path</a>, in which
    case they will override the internal definitions when producing
    label text.

    <p>
    The same default character maps are also used by default for the
    vector font in the <a href="xic:logo"><b>logo</b></a> command, for
    producing physical characters with wire elements.  These too can
    be overridden by definitions from a file.  The <b>Dump Vector
    Font</b> button in the setup panel of the <a
    href="xic:logo"><b>logo</b></a> command can be used to dump the
    current set of character maps to a file.  Character maps from this
    file can be modified and placed in a file named
    "<tt>xic_logofont</tt>" in the library <a
    href="xicpaths">search path</a>, in which case they will
    override the internal definitions when producing vector-based
    characters in the <b>logo</b> command.

    <p>
    The generated font file consists of vector specifications for the
    characters "!" through "~" in the ASCII chart.  The user's file
    need not contain all characters, missing characters will use the
    internal default definitions.

    <p>
    The file consists of character specifications of the form
    described below.  The first line of the specification defines the
    character.  This is followed by one or more path vertex lists
    which define the "strokes" of the character.  These are followed
    by a couple of numerical entries which affect placement.  For
    example, the entry for the default exclamation point (!) appears
    as:
 
    <blockquote><tt>
    character !<br>
    path 4,2 4,7<br>
    path 4,9 4,10<br>
    width 2<br>
    offset 4<br>
    </tt></blockquote>

    <p>
    The coordinate system has its origin in the upper left corner. 
    The size is limited to 256 X 256, but the basic cell size used by
    the default set is 7 X 14.  The y values increase downward, and x
    values increase to the right.  Row and column numbering begin with
    0, and negative values are not permitted.

    <p>
    Only the first character of the leading keyword is necessary, and
    this is case insensitive.  The first line of the block defines the
    character.  The order of the following lines is unimportant.  Each
    <tt>path</tt> is a sequence of coordinates which render a part of
    the character.  The <tt>width</tt> is the horizontal space
    provided for the character, which should include trailing space,
    typically one column.  The <tt>offset</tt> is the column which is
    placed at the end of the preceding character.  Row and column
    numbering begin with 0.
