    <p>
    When started with the <b>Help</b> button in the <a
    href="xic:helpmenu"><b>Help Menu</b></a>, "help mode" is active,
    and pressing the various menu buttons will bring up the help text
    describing that command.  Information about screen objects can be
    obtained by clicking on them with the first (left) mouse button. 
    One can exit help mode by pressing the <b>Esc</b> key while the
    pointer is in the main window.  The help window will remain
    visible and links in the text can be followed, but menu buttons
    will have their normal functions.  Note that when pressing
    <b>Esc</b> while in help mode, the <b>Mode</b> indicator in the <a
    href="statusline">status line</a> will revert to "Idle" from "HELP".

    <p>
    Pressing the <b>Quit</b> button in the <b>File</b> menu of the
    help window will delete the window and also exit help mode if
    active.

    <p>
    While help mode is active, one can execute a menu command
    normally, by holding the <b>Shift</b> key while clicking on the
    command button.

    <p>
    The <a href="!help"><b>!help</b></a> command, given in the <a
    href="promptline">prompt line</a>, will also bring up a help
    window, but will not enter help mode.  The help window can be used
    as a general-purpose viewer for text, html, and image files and
    URLs.

The EDITOR Feature Set
!!HTML
    This feature set corresponds to the <i>XicII</i> virtual product. 
    This was once a stand-alone layout editor product.  Currently, the
    same functionality is provided via running <i>Xic</i> with the
    EDITOR feature set, which was formerly imposed during license
    authentication.

    <p>
    One can force running with the EDITOR feature set by setting the
    environment variable <tt>FORCE_XICII</tt> before starting the
    <i>Xic</i> program.

    <p>
    This feature set restricts the functionality to physical layout
    editing.  This provides a low-cost alternative for users that do
    not require the full functionality of <i>Xic</i>.  We will
    continue to use "<i>XicII</i>" to refer to <i>Xic</i> running with
    this feature set.

    <p>
    In order to streamline support and maintenance, the documentation
    tree, i.e., the manual, help database, and release notes, is
    common to all feature sets.  This is a slight disadvantage to
    users of restricted feature sets, as the documentation contains
    descriptions of disabled features, which may lead to confusion. 
    However, this greatly simplifies maintaining the documentation.

    <p>
    This document will list the differences and features that are
    unavailable in the <i>XicII</i> virtual product.

    <ol>
    <p>
    <li><b>Technology File</b><br>
    Parts of the technology file that relate to features that are not
    available in <i>XicII</i> are ignored, but will generate warning
    messages.  In the example technology files, these features are
    enclosed in macro-tested blocks to avoid the warnings.  The syntax
    is

    <blockquote>
    <tt>If FEATURESET == "FULL"</tt><br>
    <tt>...</tt><br>
    <tt>EndIf</tt>
    </blockquote>
    The right side of the conditional can take these values:

    <dt><tt>"VIEWER"</tt><dd>
    Layout viewing feature set (<i>Xiv</i>)
    </dl>

    <p>
    <li><b>No Design Rule Checking</b><br>
    <i>XicII</i> does not have DRC support, consequently there is no
    <b>DRC Menu</b> in <i>XicII</i>.

    <p>
    <li><b>No Electrical Mode</b><br>
    <i>XicII</i> is a physical layout tool only.  There is no
    schematic entry, and no SPICE capability.
    There is no <b>Electrical</b> or <b>Physical</b> button in the
    <b>View Menu</b>.

    <p>
    <li><b>No Extraction</b><br>
    <i>XicII</i> has no extraction capability and no <b>Extract
    Menu</b>.

    <p>
    <li><b>No Batch or Server Modes</b><br>
    The background processing capability is not available in
    <i>XicII</i>.

    <p>
    <li><b>'!' Commands</b><br>
    The '!' commands in <i>XicII</i> are identical to those in
    <i>Xic</i>, however '!' commands in <i>XicII</i> which relate to
    unavailable features will not be recognized.

    <p>
    One can force running with the VIEWER feature set by setting the
    environment variable <tt>FORCE_XIV</tt> before starting the
    <i>Xic</i> program.

    <p>
    This feature set restricts the functionality to physical layout
    viewing.  This provides a low-cost alternative for users that do

MOSIS SCMOS Design Rules
!!HTML
    The generic MOSIS design rules are currently available as a PDF
    document at (use link for downloading, <b>Shift-click</b> in Mozy)
    <a href="http://www.mosis.com/files/scmos/scmos.pdf">
    <tt>www.mosis.com/files/scmps/scmos.pdf</tt></a>.

    <p>
    The <tt>xic_tech.scmos</tt> example technology file is based on
    these rules.  Although it is apparently possible to use these
    rules with some Mosis processes, most vendors provide customized
    technology descriptions and design rules as part of the process
    design kit (PDK) provided by the foundry.  <i>Xic</i> is
    compatible with <a href="cdscompat">Cadence Virtuoso</a>
    technology, display resource, and layer mapping files, so that use
    of the Mosis rules is no longer common.

    The figure shows a view of the <i>Xic</i> graphical user
    interface.  There is generally a single large window present when
    <i>Xic</i> first starts.  The window can be repositioned, and the
    size of the window can be adjusted through the window manager
    methods.

    <p>
    <img src="mainwin.png">

    <p>
    The column of buttons along the left is the <a
    href="sidemenu">side menu</a> and is visible when the current cell
    is being edited.  To the right is the scrollable <a
    href="layertab">layer table</a>, which displays the layers
    supported by the process.  If the <a
    href="XIC_MENU_RIGHT"><tt>XIC_MENU_RIGHT</tt></a> variable is set
    in the <a href="xic:env">environment</a> when <i>Xic</i> starts,
    the layer table and side menu will be located along the right of
    the window.  If the <a
    href="XIC_HORIZ_BUTTONS"><tt>XIC_HORIZ_BUTTONS</tt></a>
    environment variable is set, the "side menu" buttons will actually
    be arrayed across the top of the window.  The side menu is only
    displayed when editing.  The layer table may also be invisible, as
    the user has this option.

    <p>
    The <a href="topbuttons">top menu</a> contains buttons and other
    controls and displays, located near the top of the window, below
    the main menu bar.  The <a href="promptline">prompt line</a>,
    where the user interacts textually, is just below the main drawing
    window.  To the left of this is the <a href="keyspresd">keys
    pressed</a> area.  Below this is the <a href="statusline">status
    line</a>, which displays information about the program state.

    <p>
    <i>Xic</i> has eleven drop-down menus, arrayed in a menu bar which
    extends across the top of the main application window.

    <p>
    If the mouse button is stationary over a menu button for a second
    or two, a "tooltip" will appear.  This is a transient window that
    contains a sentence describing the function of the command.  This
    also provides the internal name for the command.  Every command
    has an internal name of five characters or fewer.  This name can
    be used as a keyboard <a href="accelerator">accelerator</a>, and
    as back-door input to the <a href="helpsys">help system</a>.  The
    help keyword for the command is "<tt>xic:</tt>" followed by the
    command name, for example "<tt>xic:prpty</tt>".  Typing a question
    mark ('<tt>?</tt>') into <i>Xic</i> followed by the keyword will
    display the help text for the command.

    The prompt line is a single-line dialog box just below the main
    drawing window.  Messages and prompts are displayed in this area,
    as well as textual input to <i>Xic</i>.

    <p>
    The prompt line has two operating modes.  In the normal mode, text
    is read-only.  Messages appear on the prompt line to provide
    information and feedback in many commands.  This is "non-editing"
    mode.

    <p>
    In non-editing mode, text can be selected by dragging with <a
    href="button1">button 1</a> held down.  Selected text is available
    for export to other windows, as the <a href="clipboard">primary
    selection</a>.

    <p>
    The prompt line can handle more text than is visible in the
    display area.  If a string is longer than the display area,
    initially the rightmost part of the message string will be shown. 
    Clicking in the prompt area with button 1 near the left border
    will show the start of the string.  Clicking in the prompt area
    near the right border will show the end of the string.  Clicking
    in the interior of the prompt area will show the middle part of
    the string, proportionate to click location.

    <a name="editing"></a>
    <h2>Prompt Line Editing</h2>

    Some commands will convert the prompt line to editing mode.  In
    this mode, the background color changes, and text typed by the
    user will appear in the prompt line window.  Keys pressed when the
    main window has focus are directed to the prompt line.

    <p>
    When editing, the behavior is slightly different depending on
    whether the mouse pointer is over the prompt line area, or not. 
    This is (or should be) true whether or not the window manager is
    click-to-focus or focus-follows-mouse.  When the mouse pointer is
    over the prompt line, which gives the prompt line complete focus,
    the prompt line background color may be different from when the
    pointer is elsewhere.  When the pointer is elsewhere, but the main
    window has focus, key presses are still sent to the prompt line,
    but there are a few keys, such as the arrow keys, which will
    operate on the drawing window rather than the prompt line.

    <p>
    When prompt line editing starts, the mouse pointer is "warped" to
    the left edge of the prompt line, providing full focus
    automatically.  With the mouse pointer over the prompt line:

    <ol>
    <li>The <b>Numeric Keypad +</b> and <b>Numeric Keypad -</b> keys
    will send a normal <tt>+</tt> or <tt>-</tt> character and not
    zoom the drawing window display.

    <li>The arrow keys will move the prompt line text cursor, or
    perform some other operation specifically for text editing,
    depending on the command.  These will not pan the display.
    </ol>

    <p>
    With the mouse pointer not over the prompt line, the keys
    mentioned will have their normal zoom and pan functionality.  In
    text edit mode, key bindings from the table below are available,
    provisionally for the arrow keys as explained.

    <blockquote>

    <tr><td><b>Enter</b></td>
     <td>Terminate editing</td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The <b>Backspace</b> key deletes the character or hypertext
    reference to the left of the cursor and moves the cursor to the
    left, and <b>Delete</b> deletes the object at the cursor. 
    <b>Ctrl-u</b> deletes the entire line.  <b>Ctrl-k</b> will delete
    the character at the cursor and all characters to the right. 
    <b>Ctrl-a</b> and <b>Ctrl-e</b> move the cursor to the beginning
    or end of the line, respectively.  The line will scroll to the
    left or right if longer that the available space, when the cursor
    hits the left and right boundaries.  The <b>Esc</b> key exits edit
    mode, discarding the input.  The <b>Enter</b> key exits edit mode,
    saving the input.  The cursor can be at any position when
    <b>Enter</b> is pressed.

    <p>
    Double-clicking with <a href="button1">button 1</a> in the prompt
    line area will effectively send an <b>Enter</b> character,
    terminating editing.  Note that a double click requires two rapid
    clicks, if too slow two single-click events will occur.

    <p>
    Special characters can be entered using the Unicode escape
    <b>Ctrl-u</b>.  The sequence starts by pressing <b>Ctrl-u</b>,
    then entering hex digits representing the character code, and is
    terminated with a space character or <b>Enter</b>.  The Unicode
    coding can be obtained from tables provided on the internet, or
    from applications such as KCharSelect which is part of the KDE
    desktop.  These are generally expressed as "<tt>U + xxxx</tt>"
    where the <tt>xxxx</tt> is a hex number.  It is the hex number
    that should be entered following <b>Ctrl-u</b>.  For example, the
    code for &pi; (pi) is <tt>03c0</tt>.  Note that special characters
    can also be selected and copied, or in some cases dragged and
    dropped, from another window.

    <p>
    There is no limit on the number of characters in the string, which
    can be much longer than the display space.  The <b>Page Down</b>
    and <b>Page Up</b> keys move the cursor to the right or left
    (respectively) by half the number of characters displayable in the
    prompt area, and will scroll if necessary to keep the cursor
    visible.

    <p>
    The <b>Ctrl-p</b> and <b>Ctrl-v</b> keys <a href="textentry">paste
    text</a> from the primary selection and clipboard, respectively,
    at the cursor.  Under Windows, these actions are identical, text
    is obtained from the Windows clipboard.  Under Unix/Linux,
    clicking with <a href="button2">button 2</a> will also paste the
    primary selection, and <a href="button3">button 3</a> will also
    paste the clipboard.  The primary selection is generally the most
    recently selected text in any window, the clipboard contains text
    that was explicitly saved via an operation in a text entry
    window.

    <p>
    While in editing mode, the <a href="keyspresd">keypress
    display</a> to the left of the prompt line is replaced with two or
    three buttons.  The <b>R</b> and <b>S</b> buttons, which are
    always present when the prompt line is in editing mode, provide
    access to five general-purpose registers for text, plus a register
    for the "last" text.  Both buttons produce a drop-down menu
    containing register numbers.  If a selection in made in the
    <b>S</b> menu, the text currently in the prompt area is saved to
    the register whose number was selected.  Any previous content is
    overwritten.  If a selection is made in the <b>R</b> menu, text
    saved in the register whose number is selected will replace the
    text in the prompt area.  The saved text can contain hypertext
    entries (see below).

    <p>
    In some contexts, a third ("<b>L</b>") button appears.  This
    provides access to the "long text" capability, which allows
    multiple lines of text to be entered by providing access to a text
    editor window.

    <p>
    When editing mode is exited, the buttons disappear and are
    replaced with the keys pressed display.  If <b>Enter</b> was
    pressed to terminate editing mode, the text is automatically saved
    in register 0, and will be available from the <b>R</b> menu the
    next time editing mode is entered.

    <p>
    For some property strings, if a line of text that is longer than
    256 characters is opened for editing on the prompt line, the <a
    href="texteditor"><b>Text Editor</b></a> will appear, loaded with
    the text.  The text will be saved as a <a href="longtext">"long
    text"</a> item.

    <p>
    These features are described in more detail in the description of
    the <a href="xic:label"><b>label</b></a> command.

    <p>
    Non-printing characters in the text will be displayed using
    special symbols, which can be edited (in edit mode) as normal
    characters.  The non-printing character most likely to appear (and
    the only one that probably should appear) corresponds to the line
    termination character.  These cause a line break when the text is
    displayed as a label on-screen, and can be entered while in
    editing mode with <b>Shift-Enter</b>.  In Windows, these are shown
    as a paragraph symbol, while in Unix/Linux a "v/t" (vertical tab)
    glyph is used.  Other characters will show as a black dot in
    Windows, or a "strange" character in Unix/Linux.

    <p>
    The prompt line participates in the drop protocol for files. 
    Files dropped on the prompt line in normal mode have the same
    effect as files dropped in the main drawing window - the file will
    be taken as layout input and displayed in the drawing window.

    <p>
    When in text editing mode, files dropped in a drawing window or
    the prompt line will not be displayed, rather the full path to the
    file is inserted into the text line at the cursor.  This means
    that when responding to a prompt to open a file, the <b>File
    Selection</b> pop-up from the <a href="xic:fsel"><b>File
    Select</b></a> button in the <a href="xic:filemenu"><b>File
    Menu</b></a> can be used to find the file.  The file can then be
    dragged into the main window or the prompt line window and
    dropped, and the name will appear on the prompt line.  Also while
    the prompt line is in editing mode, pressing the <b>Open</b>
    (green octagon) button or the <b>Open</b> menu entry of the
    <b>File Selection</b> pop-up will load the selected file path into
    the prompt line rather than opening the cell for editing.  In most
    situations where <i>Xic</i> prompts for a file path via the prompt
    line, a simplified version of the <b>File Selection</b> pop-up
    will appear while editing is active.

    <a name=hypertext"></a>
    <h2>Hypertext</h2>

    <i>Xic</i> contains a "hypertext" capability, which is active in
    electrical mode.  By default, the names of circuit nodes and
    devices are internally assigned, implying that the name of a
    particular device or node name of a particular wire net might not
    be well defined.  This poses a problem when one wishes to identify
    a specific device or wire net by name.  The hypertext feature
    addresses this issue, as do the <a href="xic:nodmp">node name
    mapping</a> and <b>name</b> property assignment features.

    <p>
    This is necessary, for example, when setting <a
    href="properties">device properties</a> which reference other
    devices or nodes.  The device names and node numbers may change,
    thus property text could become invalid if it were static. 
    Instead, internally, strings are stored as data structures which
    reference pure text as well as devices and nodes by internal
    reference.  Thus, these hypertext strings are always valid.

    <p>
    One creates a hypertext reference by clicking on the schematic
    while text input is being solicited in the prompt area.  The
    returned data can be a node reference, a device branch reference,
    or a device name.  The string, as currently defined, is inserted
    into the displayed text in the prompt area in color.  Note that
    one can only delete the whole item with the <b>Delete</b> and
    <b>Backspace</b> keys, the hypertext references are treated as
    single items.

    <p>
    One will encounter hypertext when using the prompt line editor as
    itemized below.  In these cases, one could type in the text,
    however if due to future modifications that text changes, the
    present text would be wrong.  If is therefor advantageous to use
    hypertext, by, e.g., clicking on a device in a drawing window
    rather than typing its name.

    <ul>
    <li>When creating text for properties applied to electrical
    devices and circuits, for referencing other devices and nets in a
    name-independent manner.  This applies when adding or editing
    properties from the <b>Property Editor</b> provided by the <a
    href="xic:prpty"><b>Properties</b></a> button in the <b>Edit
    Menu</b>, and when subsequently editing the label text (and
    underlying property) using the <a
    href="xic:label"><b>label</b></a> button in the side menu.

    <p>
    <li>When creating <a href="xic:label">labels</a> that require
    reference to devices or nodes, such as using <a
    href="spicetext">spicetext</a> labels to add such things as
    <tt>.measure</tt> lines.

    <p>
    When creating a label, clicking on a connection point in the
    drawing, for example, will enter a hypertext link to the node into
    the label.  The hypertext is shown in a different color in the
    prompt line.  The label will always display the correct name for
    the node, should the name subsequently change.  This is the means
    by which node labels can be added to the drawing.

    <p>
    <li>When selecting nodes and branches to <a
    href="xic:plot">plot</a>, after simulation.  The reference points
    selected by clicking are all hypertext.
    </ul>

    <p>
    There are three types of reference that can be defined by clicking
    in a schematic.

    <ol>
    <li> Node Reference<br>
    If the user clicks over a wire or on a contact point of a device
    or subcircuit, a node reference is established.  The colored
    hypertext entered into the prompt line as a response is of the
    SPICE form "<tt>V(<i>name</i>)</tt>", where <i>name</i> is the
    node name, which is an integer by default.  The string, when
    printed or shown as a label, will always show the correct name for
    the node selected.

    <p>
    <li> "Hidden" Target<br>
    Some devices have a "hidden" target, which is usually shown as a
    '+' symbol as part of the device schematic representation.  The
    hidden targets are defined in the device definition in the <a
    href="devlib">device library</a> file, so that the meaning and
    location may differ.  In the default device library, most
    two-terminal devices have such a point, which generally returns a
    branch node or function which specifies the current through the
    device.  For Josephson junctions, the target represents the
    junction phase.  Clicking on this point in a drawing window will
    insert the corresponding reference.

    <p>
    <li> Name Reference<br>
    Clicking within the bounding box of a device or subcircuit, but
    not over a node or hidden target, will insert a name reference. 
    The returned text is the name of the instance, as derived from the
    <b>name</b> property attached to the device or subcircuit.  This
    can be applied by the user, to give the device a fixed name.  If
    no <b>name</b> property is applied by the user, <i>Xic</i> will
    generate one with an internally generated name.
    </ol>

    <p>
    The node references and hidden targets are also the sensitive
    points when using the <a href="xic:plot"><b>plot</b></a> and <a
    href="xic:iplot"><b>iplot</b></a> commands.

    <p>
    Note that these targets are active at any level of the hierarchy. 
    However, they are generally not selectable unless the containing
    subcell is shown expanded as a schematic.  If a subcircuit is
    shown as a symbol, one can still select internal points for
    hypertext references by using a proxy window.  This is described
    in the next section.

    <p>
    This feature can be used to set up specialized SPICE output. 
    Suppose one wishes to use a <tt>.save</tt> line in <i>WRspice</i>. 
    A <a href="spicetext">spicetext</a> label can be created, where
    the nodes to be included in the save are inserted in the label by
    clicking on the drawing.  The resulting <tt>.save</tt> line will
    always save the clicked-on nodes, whether or not the actual node
    names change.

    <p>
    For another example, suppose one needs to apply a functional
    dependence to a voltage source in the circuit to the voltage of
    some node.  One would accomplish this with the following
    procedure.
    <ol>
    <li>Open the <a href="xic:prpty"><b>Property Editor</b></a> and
    use the <b>Add</b> menu to initiate addition of a <b>value</b>
    property.
    <li>In the prompt line, type the equation representing the
    desired functional dependence, and whenever the node voltage text
    is needed, click on that node in a drawing window.
    <li>Press <b>Enter</b> to complete the operation.
    </ol>

    <p>
    The equation should appear in the property label near the voltage
    source.  This could be, for example, "<tt>2*v(4) + v(5)</tt>", if
    default node names are used.  Later, after modifying the circuit,
    one might notice that the label now reads "2*v(6) + v(8)".  The
    internal node numbering has changed due to the modification, but
    the source still references the correct circuit nodes.  This would
    not be the case if ordinary text was used for the equation string.

    <a name="hyproxy"></a>
    <h2>Proxy Windows</h2>

    If one presses the <b>Ctrl</b> and <b>Shift</b> keys while
    clicking with <a href="button1">button 1</a> on a subcell, a <a
    href="xic:vport">sub-window</a> will appear, containing the
    content of the subcell.  This works in electrical and physical
    mode, while the prompt line editor is active and not.

    <p>
    In electrical mode, the sub-window will display the master as a
    schematic, whether or not it is set to display symbolically.  The
    sub-window, in this case has the important feature that it is a
    proxy for the main window for hypertext.  When using the prompt
    line editor, clicking in the sub-window can add hypertext
    references to the prompt line, just like clicking in the main
    window.

    <p>
    One can also hold <b>Ctrl</b> and <b>Shift</b> and click on an
    instance in a proxy window, which will produce a new proxy window
    showing the master of the clicked-on instance.  One can repeat the
    procedure to any depth, however at present there are only four
    sub-windows available, and windows will be reused if the depth
    exceeds four.

    <p>
    When a sub-window is active as a proxy, a label is displayed in
    the window menu bar.  This will give the "proxy path" which
    consists of one or more subcircuit names, separated by periods. 
    These are the subcircuits clicked on, up to the top level.  The
    sub-window otherwise behaves normally, and one can switch to view
    another cell, or go to physical mode.  The proxy label will
    disappear, and the sub-window will no longer act as a proxy.  If
    one returns to viewing the original cell, the label and capability
    will return.

    When giving input to <i>Xic</i>, single and double quotes can be

    <p>
    As an example, consider the prompt of the <a
    href="xic:open"><b>Open</b></a> command.  The command prompt
    expects one or two tokens.  The first token is the name of a file
    to open.  The second token, if given, is the name of the cell to
    edit if the first token names a multi-cell file such as a GDSII
    file.  Suppose that your file is in a directory named "<tt>Xic
    Files</tt>".  Without the quoting mechanism, there is an obvious
    problem.  To edit the file, one enters, for example (each of these
    would work),

    <blockquote><tt>
    "Xic Files"/my_design.gds<br>
    "Xic Files/my_design.gds"<br>
    Xic" "Files/my_design.gds
    </tt></blockquote>

    <p>
    The double quotes make each of these strings appear to <i>Xic</i>
    as a single word.

Keypress Buffer
!!HTML
    To the left of the <a href="promptline">prompt line</a> is the key
    press buffer area.  This area displays the last five keys typed
    into the main drawing window.  in the keypress buffer.  The
    keypress buffer remembers up to 16 characters, though only the
    last five are shown.  It is cleared when <b>Esc</b> or
    <b>Ctrl-u</b> is typed.  If the key sequence in the buffer
    uniquely prefixes a menu command, the command name is displayed,
    and the command is executed.  The command names are a short
    mnemonic, displayed in the "tooltip" that appears when the pointer
    rests over a command or menu button.

    <p>
    Most commands have at most five characters in their command name,
    the exceptions are the scripts in the <a href="xic:usermenu"><b>User
    Menu</b></a>.  For these, the menu text is the same as the command
    name, and it may take more than five characters to uniquely define
    the command.

    <p>
    The keypress buffer can be forced to literally match menu items by
    typing <b>Enter</b>.  Consider the two entries in the <b>User
    Menu</b>:  <tt>spiral</tt> and <tt>spiralform</tt>.  Typing
    "spiral" does nothing, as this is a prefix of both entries.  In
    order to run spiral by typing the command prefix, type "spiral"
    then <b>Enter</b>.  This works for any menu commands where one
    entire command is a prefix of another.

    <p>
    When the <a href="promptline">prompt line</a> is in editing mode,
    i.e., a command is active that requires user text input, the keys
    display is replaced by buttons associated with the editing
    function.  The key press display returns when editing mode is
    exited.

    <p>
    Each drawing window (main window and the sub-windows produced with
    the <a href="xic:vport"><b>Viewport</b></a> button in the <b>View
    Menu</b>) has its own keypress buffer, and matching commands will
    apply to the window into which the text was typed, if applicable. 
    In sub-windows, the key press buffer displays in the menu bar
    area, to the right.

Menu Selection and Accelerators
!!HTML
    <p>
    Menus from the main menu bar are displayed when the left mouse
    button (button 1) is pressed over a menu bar entry.  The drop-down
    listing of entries will appear.  A selection can be made by
    releasing the mouse button over the item to be selected. 
    Alternatively, clicking the mouse button will also cause the menu
    to appear, and clicking over the menu will select the item under
    the pointer, and retire the menu.  While the menu is visible,
    key presses are "grabbed" by the menu, and so will not be sent to
    other windows or applications.  While a menu is visible, the up
    and down arrow keys will cycle through the menu entries,
    highlighting each in sequence.  Pressing <b>Enter</b> will "press"
    the highlighted entry.  The entries in the side menu are mostly
    toggle buttons, which are activated by clicking with mouse button
    1.

    <p>
    Commands can also be executed by typing an accelerator while the
    mouse pointer is in a drawing window.  Commands can be exited by
    selecting another command in most cases, or by pressing the
    <b>Esc</b> key.  Some commands are switches which remain in effect
    until selected again.

    <p>
    There are multiple accelerator functions available.

    <ol>
    <li><b>Alt</b>-<i>char</i> brings up the menu keyed by <i>char</i>
    where <i>char</i> is the character that is underlined in the name
    in the menu bar.  If this is followed by a character underlined in
    one of the menu entries, that function is invoked.  For example,
    typing <tt>Alt-f</tt> (Press and hold <b>Alt</b>, press <b>f</b>,
    release <b>Alt</b>, press <b>p</b>) engages the <b>Print</b>
    command in the <b>File Menu</b>. 

    <p>
    <li>If the menu entry has something in the second column, that is
    also an accelerator.  For example, in the <b>File Menu</b>, the
    <b>Quit</b> entry has "<b>Ctrl-q</b>" listed in the second column. 
    This indicates that pressing <b>Ctrl-q</b> will invoke the
    <b>Quit</b> command.  The menu doesn't have to be visible.

    <p>
    Under Unix/Linux, the menu accelerators can be changed
    interactively.  Click on a menu to open it, then move the pointer
    over one of the entries (it will be highlighted).  Pressing
    <b>Shift</b>, <b>Ctrl</b> or <b>Alt</b> key along with another key
    will add that accelerator to the menu entry, or change an existing
    accelerator.  With the menu invisible, entering that key
    combination will "press" the assigned button, unless the
    combination happens to be used elsewhere for another purpose (it
    must be unique in the menus, at least).  Under Windows, the menu
    accelerators can not be changed.

    <p>
    <li>Every command has a name, shown in the tooltip bubble that
    appears after the pointer is stationary over the button for a
    second or two.  Typing the first few characters of this name will
    trigger that command.  Only the characters required to uniquely
    specify the command name among all commands currently is scope are
    required.  When activated, the name of the command is printed in
    the key press buffer window.  For example, "<tt>pus</tt>" triggers
    <b>Push</b>.

    <p>
    <li>One can define macros for keypress combinations with the <a
    href="xic:macro"><b>Define Macro</b></a> command in the <a
    href="xic:attrmenu"><b>Attributes Menu</b></a>.

    The main window must have the keyboard focus in order for
    <i>Xic</i> to receive keyboard input.  Under some window managers,
    including under Windows, the frame of the main window can be
    clicked on to give that window the focus, and the focus will
    remain with that window regardless of the location of the pointer. 
    In other cases, the pointer must be in the main window in order to
    give the main window the focus.

    <p>
    If a command is active that is prompting for input, the keystrokes
    will appear on the <a href="promptline">prompt line</a>, the <a

    the key bindings that are in force while in editing mode.

    <p>
    If not in editing mode, the characters will be added to the buffer
    displayed in the keys area.  After each character is added to the
    buffer, the buffer is compared with all menu command names, and if
    the buffer uniquely matches the first characters of a menu button
    name, that button will be activated.  Only a few characters can be
    saved in the buffer, and after the buffer is full, keystrokes will
    be ignored.  The buffer can be cleared with <b>Ctrl-u</b> (hold
    the <b>Ctrl</b> key and press <b>u</b>).  The buffer is also
    cleared after each command match, although the display will show

Keyboard '?' Help Directives
!!HTML
    Just as the '!' character switches the prompt line to editing mode
    to accept a <a href="keybang">command</a>, the '?' character will
    switch to editing mode, to accept a "help directive".

    <p>
    A "help directive" can be one of the following:
    <ul>
    <li>A help system keyword, so "? <i>keyword</i>" is the same as
      "<tt>!help</tt> <i>keyword</i>", i.e., a shortcut to the <a
      href="!help"><b>!help</b></a> command.  If no <i>keyword</i> is
      given, and the program is in a command mode, meaning that the
      <b>Mode</b> entry in the <a href="statusline">status line</a> is
      something other than "<tt>MAIN</tt>", then the help shown will
      apply to the current mode.  Otherwise, the default help topic is
      shown, as for "<tt>!help</tt>" without arguments.

    <li>A general URL or path to a compatible local file.  The help
      window will display the file or URL, if possible.  In
      particular, image files can be displayed this way.  A URL must
      be complete, including the "<tt>http://</tt>" prefix.  Most web
      sites use style sheets and other constructs not handled by the
      simple rendering engine in the viewer window, so it is not great
      for general web-surfing, but it may be good enough for some
      purposes.

    <li>One of the single character directives.  These apply only
      after '?', and print information that is not from the help
      system, but derived from internal tables.  These are given in the
      table below.
    </ul>

    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th>Character</th>  <th>Result</th></tr>
    <tr><td><b>!, b, B</b></td>
      <td>Giving exactly one of these characters will print a listing
      of the '!' <a href="keybang">commands</a> that are available in
      the program.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>v, V</b></td>
      <td>Giving exactly one of these characters will print a
      listing of the variable names that have significance within
      the program.  Variables are listed whether or not the variable
      is actually set.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>s, S</b></td>
      <td>Giving exactly one of these characters will print a list of
      variables that are currently set, the same as the <a

    <tr><td><b>f, F</b></td>
      <td>Giving exactly one of these characters will print a list of
      all of the internal script <a href="scr:iffuncs">interface
      functions</a> available within the program.</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
    Each listing will provide the listed items as colored links.
    Clicking on the links will pop up help about the item.

    The <i>Xic</i> program is modular, and the <a

    virtual programs are effectively <i>Xic</i> with only a subset of
    modules.  The listings provide definitive summaries of the

    case this is not clear from the documentation.

    This key sends an interrupt signal to <i>Xic</i>.  When an

    operation.  This occurs within the <a href="xic:drcmenu">DRC</a> and
    <a href="xic:extmenu">Extraction</a> functions, and geometrical
    commands such as <a href="!join"><b>!join</b></a> and <a

    writing.  If an interrupt is received while drawing to the screen,
    the drawing immediately terminates, without user confirmation. 
    Script execution is also terminated immediately.

    <p>
    Under Microsoft Windows, pressing the <b>Pause/Break</b> key also
    sends an interrupt signal if <i>Xic</i> has the keyboard focus.

    <p>
    When the "wait" cursor is active when the mouse pointer is in a
    drawing window, <i>Xic</i> is "busy".  When busy, <i>Xic</i> locks
    out all key press events except for <b>Ctrl-c</b>, and most mouse
    button events.  If a locked-out event is received, a pop-up will
    appear that informs the user that <i>Xic</i> is busy and to use
    <b>Ctrl-c</b> to abort the operation.  This pop-up will disappear
    after three seconds (trying to destroy it with the mouse won't
    work).

    <p>
    When <i>Xic</i> is busy and <b>Ctrl-c</b> is pressed, the
    operation may be paused, and the user is asked (on the prompt
    line) whether to abort or continue.  While waiting for input, most
    buttons are desensitized.  Those that are not are the <a

    All other events are dispatched normally while busy, so that

    <i>Xic</i> is most efficiently used with a three-button mouse,
    trackball, or other input device.  The three buttons are normally
    numbered from the left, with the mouse pointing upward.  This
    manual will refer to buttons by their number according to this
    convention.

    <p>
    A two-button mouse, as commonly used with PC hardware, does not
    provide button 2 (the "middle" button).  Although a three-button
    pointing device is recommended, in current <i>Xic</i> releases the
    important button 2 operations can be simulated using button 1 or
    3, while holding a modifier key.  Thus, for many users, a
    two-button mouse should be entirely adequate.

    <p>
    In short, <a href="button1">button 1</a> is used for basic point
    and click operations and menu selections.  The middle button, <a
    href="button2">button 2</a>, is used for pan operations in drawing
    windows, and the right button, <a href="button3">button 3</a>, is
    used for zooming in the drawing windows.

    <p>
    In addition, drawing windows respond to <a href="mousewheel">mouse
    wheel</a> events.  The basic action is vertical scrolling, however
    if <b>Shift</b> is held, the window will scroll horizontally.  If
    <b>Ctrl</b> is held (which overrides <b>Shift</b>) the display
    will zoom in or out.  The mouse wheel sensitivity can be changed
    with the <a href="MouseWheel"><tt>MouseWheel</tt></a> variable.  A
    mouse wheel will also provide scrolling capability in text windows
    and the help viewer on most systems.

    Button 1 (the left button) is used for point operations in the
    drawing windows, and for activating command buttons and sliders in
    menus and pop-ups.  In most cases, a "point operation" can be
    effected in two ways:  click twice, or hold and drag.  If the
    pointer does not move too much as button 1 is pressed and
    released, a single point is defined, and most commands will prompt
    the user to point a second time to complete the operation.  If
    button 1 is held while the pointer moves, upon release the
    operation is completed, using the press and release coordinates. 
    A rectangle defining the two positions is typically ghost-drawn
    while the point operation is in progress.

    <p>
    The delay interval which is used to differentiate a "click" from a
    "hold" or "drag" can be adjusted by setting the <a
    href="SelectTime"><b>SelectTime</b></a> variable with the <a
    href="!set"><b>!set</b></a> command.  The default value is 250
    milliseconds, and the adjustable range is 100-1000 milliseconds. 
    Some users may find that setting the delay to a larger value
    improves the ability to differentiate between the operations
    described below.

    <p>
    Outside of any command, button 1 performs selection, move/copy,
    and stretch operations.  The <b>Shift</b> and <b>Ctrl</b> keys act
    as modifiers for the button 1 presses.  The following sections
    describe the normal operations.

    <p>
    If <b>Shift</b>, <b>Ctrl</b>, and <b>Alt</b> are all held while
    button 1 is pressed, a "no-operation" (<a
    href="noopbutton">button4</a>) press is simulated.  This performs
    no action, but updates the <a href="coordline">coordinate
    readout</a> window.

    <p>
    If <b>Shift</b> and <b>Ctrl</b> are both held while clicking on a
    physical cell instance or electrical subcircuit, a <a
    href="xic:vport">sub-window</a> will appear containing the
    contents of the subcell or subcircuit.  In electrical mode, the
    new window will display the subcell schematic, and be a <a
    href="xic:proxy">proxy</a> for the main window for hypertext,
    including plot reference points.  Clicking in the sub-window will
    assign hypertext reference points, as if one clicked in the main
    window.  This is how one can get hypertext references of assign
    plot points from a cell that is shown as an instance symbolically.

    <p>
    with only the <b>Ctrl</b> key held, clicking on a selected cell
    instance will provide access to resources as described.  If the
    selected instance is a normal cell, the <a
    href="xic:prpty"><b>Property Editor</b></a> panel, with the
    clicked-on instance as the current object, will appear.  If the
    selected instance master is a parameterized cell (<a
    href="xic:pcells">pcell</a>), the <a
    href="xic:pcparams"><b>Parameters</b></a> panel appears, allowing
    the user to reparameterize the instance.  If the selected instance
    is a <a href="stdvia">standard via</a>, the <a
    href="xic:crvia"><b>Standard Via Parameters</b></b> panel will
    appear, allowing the user to alter ther structure of the via.

    <a name="selection"></a>
    <h2>Basic Selection Operation</h2>

    If neither of the <b>Shift</b> and <b>Ctrl</b> keys is pressed,
    clicking on an object will toggle its selected status.  Objects
    which are selected are drawn with a blinking boundary.  These
    objects are acted on by many of the button commands, so that
    object selection in an important part of <i>Xic</i> operation. 
    The number of selected objects, if any, is displayed in the <a
    href="statusline">status area</a> below the layer table.  This
    information is useful, as selected objects can be off-screen,
    leading to unintended consequences.

    <p>
    The default selection operation is described here.  The selection
    behavior can be modified from the <b>Selection Control Panel</b>
    brought up by the <a href="xic:selcp"><b>selcp</b></a> button in
    the <a href="topbuttons">top button menu</a>.  Only objects on
    layers that are both visible and selectable (as shown in the <a
    href="layertab">layer table</a>) can be selected.

    <p>
    Clicking on a single object will toggle the selection status of
    the object.  If the point where the object was clicked is also
    over a subcell, the object and not the subcell will be selected or
    deselected; subcells are affected only if there is no other
    geometry at the selection point. 

    <p>
    It is impossible to select an object or subcell with mouse
    operations whose boundary is completely invisible in all display
    windows.  Such objects can be deselected, however.

    <p>
    When clicking on an intersecting point of several objects, there
    are two types of logic available.  In the default logic, when
    clicking on the intersection area of several unselected objects,
    only one of the objects is selected, and repeatedly clicking in
    the same spot will selected a different object, deselecting the
    previous selection if any.  Thus, one can cycle through the
    candidates and select only the one of interest.  If two or more of
    the objects are already selected, only one of the selected objects
    will be deselected, and no new object will be selected.  If
    exactly one object is selected, it will be deselected, and the
    "next" object will be selected.  If there is no "next" object,
    then there will be no new selection.  The "next" object is subject
    to the ordering of layers in the layer table (top to bottom) and
    database ordering (sorted descending in the Y value and ascending
    in the X value of the upper left corner of the object's bounding
    box).

    <p>
    In the "legacy" logic, which was used in releases through 2.5.63,
    clicking on an intersecting point of several unselected objects
    will select them all.  However, clicking on the intersection area
    of several selected objects will <i>not</i> deselect them all. 
    The logic in this case is similar to the default logic.  If more
    that one object is selected, only one of the objects will be
    deselected per click in an intersecting area.  When only one of
    the objects remains selected, the next click will deselect the
    selected object, and select the other objects.

    <p>
    If the variable <a href="NoAltSelection"><b>NoAltSelection</b></a>
    is set, <i>Xic</i> will use the legacy logic.

    <p>
    Clicking (<i>not</i> dragging) on an empty part of the drawing
    will deselect the single object at the head of the selection list,
    if any, which is the object most recently selected.  This applies
    when no command is active, not when selections are performed within
    commands.

    <p>
    If neither of the <b>Shift</b> or <b>Ctrl</b> keys is pressed, and
    button 1 is pressed, dragged, and released, the selection status
    of objects that intersect the defined rectangle is toggled.  This
    is an "area select".  Unlike clicking (or "point select"), the
    selection status of all affected objects is toggled by an area
    select.  During the drag, the rectangle defined for the area
    select is ghost drawn.  In area select, qualifying instances are
    always selected or deselected, whether or not other geometry is
    present.

    <p>
    A special case applies in both point and area selection, when only
    physical cell instances are selectable, and three or more
    instances would be selected.  The <b>Select Instances</b> pop-up
    appears, which provides a listing of the selectable instances,
    along with colored "yes/no" text indicating the present selected
    state of each instance.  The state can be toggled by clicking on
    the colored text.  This is a useful feature for designs containing
    a large number of overlapping cell instances.  The same pop-up may
    appear in other contexts when instances are being chosen for some
    operation.  In this case, the nomenclature is slightly different
    ("Choose" instead of "Select").  In both cases, the pop-up is
    modal, meaning that most interface objects other than the pop-up
    are locked while the pop-up is visible.

    <p>
    In either point or area select, if the instance bounding box is
    not visible in the window, the instance will not be selected,
    which may prevent accidents.

    <p>
    In electrical mode with point selection, objects are acted upon
    hierarchically.  Wires have the highest precedence, followed by
    labels, instances, and boxes.  Only the clicked-on objects with
    the highest precedence are acted upon, if there are multiple
    objects clicked on.  For example, clicking on a wire over a
    subcircuit will select or deselect the wire, but ignore the
    subcircuit.  With area selection, all qualifying objects will be
    acted upon.

    <p>
    When the selection operation is completed, the status of the
    modifier keys determines how the chosen objects are processed.  If
    neither of <b>Shift</b> or <b>Ctrl</b> is pressed, the action is
    as described.  if <b>Shift</b> is pressed (but not <b>Ctrl</b>),
    any unselected objects are selected.  If <b>Ctrl</b> is pressed
    (but not <b>Shift</b>) any selected objects are deselected.  If
    both <b>Shift</b> and <b>Ctrl</b> are held, the selection status
    of each object is reversed.  This is the default for area
    selections, but not point selections.

    <p>
    The <a href="xic:desel"><b>desel</b></a> button can be used to
    deselect all selected objects.  This acts on all selected objects,
    whether or not they are on the current layer.  The <a
    href="!select"><b>!select</b></a> command is another mechanism
    whereby objects can be selected.

    <a name="movecopy"></a>
    <h2>Basic Move/Copy Operation</h2>

    Objects must first be selected in order to be moved or copied. 
    These operations are short-cuts to the <a
    href="xic:move"><b>Move</b></a> and <a
    href="xic:copy"><b>Copy</b></a> commands in the <a
    href="xic:modifymenu"><b>Modify Menu</b></a>.  There are also <a
    href="!mo"><b>!mo</b></a> (move) and <a href="!co"><b>!co</b></a>
    (copy) commands available for text-mode input from the prompt
    line.

    <p>
    If the <b>Shift</b> key is down when the user presses button 1,
    and the pointer is over a selected object, then a move/copy
    operation on all of the selected objects is initiated. 
    Alternatively, pressing button 1 with no keys pressed over a
    selected object and holding, motionless for a brief period, will
    similarly initiate a move/copy operation.  In the first case, if
    the user releases button 1 immediately (clicks) then the outlines
    of the selected objects are "attached" to the pointer and the
    move/copy operation will complete when the user clicks a second
    time.  Alternatively, the user can drag the pointer (with button 1
    still pressed), and the release event will complete the operation. 
    In the second case, the pointer must remain motionless with button
    1 down for a brief period.  The user can release button 1, at
    which point the objects are attached to the pointer, and complete
    the operation with a second button 1 press.  Alternatively, the
    user can begin to drag, and complete the operation by releasing
    button 1.  The brief period of inactivity, or the fact that the
    <b>Shift</b> key is pressed, signals the start of a move/copy
    operation.

    <p>
    Pressing the <b>SpaceBar</b> toggles whether the operation is in
    move or copy mode.  The last state is remembered in the next
    operation.  A message in the prompt area indicates the current
    mode, which will apply when the operation completes.

    <p>
    When in copy mode, a replication count will be read from the <a
    href="keyspresd">keypress buffer</a> of the current window when
    the copy is performed.  This is an integer, entered by typing into
    the window.  If not found or out of the range 1-100000, a single
    copy is made.  Otherwise, multiple copies will be created, at
    multiples of the translation distance.

    <p>
    Also in copy mode, when clicking twice rather than dragging, the
    object being copied remains "attached" to the mouse pointer, so
    that additional copies can be placed by simply clicking.  Pressing
    <b>Esc</b> will terminate this mode.

    <p>
    If the <b>Shift</b> key is down when the operation is completed,
    the angle of translation is constrained to be multiples of 45
    degrees.  This constraint is visible during the move/copy by
    observing the behavior or the ghost-drawn outlines as the pointer
    moves.  This is often useful for making sure that the new location
    is horizontally, vertically, or diagonally aligned with the
    original location.

    <p>
    If the <b>Enter</b> is pressed during a move, when the objects
    being moved are ghost-drawn and attached to the pointer, the
    reference point of the object becomes the lower left corner of the
    bounding box of the objects.  Pressing <b>Enter</b> will cycle the
    reference point through the corners of the bounding box, and back
    to the original reference location.  Note that this allows objects
    that have somehow gotten off-grid to be returned to the grid.

    <p>
    It is possible to change the layer of objects during a move/copy
    operation.  During the time that objects are ghost drawn and
    attached to the mouse pointer, if the <a href="layertab">current
    layer</a> is changed, the objects that are attached can be placed
    on the new layer.  Subcells are not affected.

    How this is applied depends on the setting of the <a
    href="LayerChangeMode"><tt>LayerChangeMode</tt></a> variable, or
    equivalently the settings of the <b>Layer Change Mode</b> pop-up
    from the <a href="xic:mclcg"><b>Set Layer Chg Mode</b></a>
    button in the <b>Modify Menu</b>.  The possible actions are to
    ignore the layer change, place objects originating from the old
    current layer on the new layer, or to place all new objects on the
    new layer.  If the current layer is set back to the previous layer
    before clicking to locate the new objects, no layers will change. 
    Note that layer change is only possible for "click-click" mode and
    not "press-drag".

    <a name="stretch"></a>
    <h2>Basic Stretch Operation</h2>

    Objects must first be selected in order to be stretched.  The
    basic stretch operation described here is also available from the
    <a href="xic:strch"><b>Stretch</b></a> command in the <b>Modify
    Menu</b>, but that command provides additional features, such as
    vertex selection, not available from the basic operation. 
    Stretching operations are also available for polygons in the <a
    href="xic:polyg"><b>polyg</b></a> command, and for wires in the <a
    href="xic:wire"><b>wire</b></a> command.

    <p>
    Clicking on a selected object with the <b>Ctrl</b> key pressed
    initiates a stretch.  If the <b>Shift</b> key is also held, an
    actual stretch command is initialted, as if the <b>Stretch</b>
    button in the <b>Modify</b> menu was pressed.  The mode changes to
    the stretch command, which can be terminated by pressing the
    <b>Esc</b> key.  The command allows use of vertex selection to
    mark and move several polygon vertices in tandem, a feature not
    available in the simple stretch operation to be described, which
    in initiated if the <b>Shift</b> key is not also pressed.

    <p>
    Any object other than subcells can be stretched, but the effect of
    the stretch differs on the various objects.  <a
    href="xic:box">Boxes</a> and <a href="xic:label">labels</a> are
    stretched in such a way as to maintain a rectangular shape.  That
    is, if a corner is stretched, the adjacent vertices are also moved
    in order to keep the internal angles 90 degrees.

    <p>
    The stretch operation works differently on Manhattan polygons than
    polygons containing nonorthogonal angles.  For non-Manhattan
    polygons, a single vertex is moved, all others remain fixed.  The
    stretch operation on Manhattan polygons is similar to the
    operation as applied to boxes, i.e., the corner and adjacent
    vertices are changed so as to keep the polygon Manhattan.  A
    single vertex can be stretched arbitrarily either by selecting the
    vertex in the <b>Stretch</b> command in the <b>Modify Menu</b>, or
    by using the vertex editor in the <a
    href="xic:polyg"><b>polyg</b></a> command.

    <p>
    If the <b>Ctrl</b> key is pressed when the user presses button 1,
    and the pointer is over a selected object that is not a subcell, a
    stretch operation will be initiated.  The operation is performed
    on all selected objects, and the new outlines are ghost drawn.  As
    for move/copy, the operation can be performed by clicking twice,
    or by dragging and releasing button 1.  For selected polygons and
    wires, the vertex nearest the button 1 press location, for each
    object, is moved.  For boxes and labels, the corner closest to the
    button down location is moved.

    <p>
    If the <b>Shift</b> key is pressed when the stretch is completed,
    the angle of translation is constrained to multiples of 45
    degrees.  This can be seen in the behavior of the ghost drawn
    outlines while the pointer moves, with and without the
    <b>Shift</b> key pressed.  At this stage, the <b>Ctrl</b> key is
    ignored.

    <a name="notes"></a>
    <h2>Additional Notes</h2>

    <p>
    Pressing the <b>Esc</b> key will terminate these operations while
    in progress.  The <b>Tab</b> and <b>Shift-Tab</b> keys will undo
    and redo the operation, respectively.  These operations sound
    complex when described in print, but become quite natural in
    practice.  The user should spend a few minutes learning these
    operations.

    <p>
    In the <a href="layertab">layer menu</a>, button 1 selects the
    current layer, as indicated by the highlight box drawn around the
    entry.  If the <b>Shift</b> or <b>Ctrl</b> key is pressed while
    clicking with button 1 in the layer menu, the action is identical
    to a <a href="button2">button 2</a> press, i.e., the layer
    visibility status is changed.  This is advantageous for users with
    a two-button pointing device, on which button 2 is usually absent.

    <p>
    Many of the pop-up windows can be moved by pressing button 1 while
    the pointer in on the background or a label object in the pop-up. 
    While button 1 is held, the outline of the pop-up is ghost-drawn
    and attached to the pointer.  The pop-up is moved to the new
    location when button 1 is released.

    Button 2 a is usually the center button on a three-button pointing
    device.  On two-button mice, the right button is typically button
    3, and button 2 is missing.  On some systems, pressing buttons 1
    and 3 simultaneously will simulate a button 2 press.  <i>Xic</i>
    provides alternative ways to perform the button 2 operations, so
    that a two-button pointing device can be used, but is a tiny bit
    less efficient.

    <p>
    If button 2 is clicked in a drawing window, the window is redrawn
    with the click location centered in the window.  If instead button
    2 is pressed and the pointer moved to a new location before
    release, the window is redrawn with the press location moved to
    the release location.  If there are multiple windows open, only
    the window under the release will be redrawn.  Thus, for example
    to change the view in a <a href="xic:vport">sub-window</a>, press
    and hold button 2 while pointing at the desired feature in the
    main (or another) window, then release button 2 while pointing in
    the sub-window.  The sub-window will show the pointed-to objects at
    the release location.

    <p>
    The same action will be initiated if button 3 is pressed while
    either the <b>Shift</b> or <b>Ctrl</b> key is held down.  The key
    state when button 3 is released does not matter.

    <p>
    In the <a href="layertab">layer menu</a>, button 2 will switch the
    visibility of layers, as indicated by the sample box.  Clicking
    button 2 on the individual layers toggles their visibility. 
    Clicking button 2 on the small box icon to the far right of the
    layer menu will toggle visibility of all layers.  All layers will
    be set to visible or invisible according to whether a majority of
    layers were originally invisible or visible, respectively.

    <p>
    The behavior is a little different between physical and electrical
    modes.  In physical mode, the screen will not be redrawn
    automatically, unless the <b>Shift</b> key is held during the
    button 2 press, but can be redrawn by clicking button 2 in the
    center of the drawing window, or by pressing the </b>Ctrl-r</b>
    key combination.

    <p>
    In electrical mode, the screen is automatically redrawn.  The SCED
    (drawing) layer is always visible.  Instead of the visibility of
    this layer being toggled, the fill setting is toggled between
    solid and empty fill.

    <p>
    The same behavior is obtained by holding <b>Shift</b> or
    <b>Ctrl</b> while clicking with <a href="button1">button 1</a> in
    the layer menu.  If <b>Shift</b> is held, the screen will be
    redrawn automatically while in physical mode.

Right Mouse Button
!!HTML
    Button 3 performs a zoom operation.  Draagging or clicking twice
    defines diagonal corners of a rectangle to zoom into.  The window
    will then display the contents of this area (after compensating
    for aspect ratio). 

    <p>
    If the same operation is done, but <b>Ctrl</b> or <b>Shift</b> is
    pressed during the drag button-up or the second mouse click,
    operation is different.  In this case, the area is marked by a
    dotted highlighting box, and a subsequent button 3 press will
    complete the operation.  A press in the same window will cause the
    area defined by the first and second points to be shrunk by the
    ratio of the diagonals of the rectangles defined by point 1, point
    2 and point 1, point 3.  To zoom in a lot, point 2 is much closer
    to point 1 than point 3 is to point 1.  Alternatively, a button 3
    press in a different window will display the boxed area of the
    first window in the second window.

    <p>
    If <b>Shift</b> or <b>Ctrl</b> is held down before the initial
    button 3 press in a drawing window, a pan operation will be
    initiated instead of the zoom, the same as if button 2 was
    pressed.

    <p>
    In the <a href="layertab">layer menu</a>, button 3 enables layer
    blinking, if neither of <b>Shift</b> or <b>Ctrl</b> is pressed. 
    Pressing and holding button 3 over a layer entry in the layer
    table will cause that layer to blink periodically in the drawing
    windows, while button 3 remains pressed.  Layers that happen to
    have the same color as the selected blinking layer will also
    blink, since the operation is sensitive only to the layer color.

    <p>
    In combination with <b>Shift</b> and <b>Ctrl</b>, clicking with
    button 3 on a layer entry provides a shortcut:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Ctrl</b>-button 3 will set the current layer to the
    clicked-on layer, and bring up the <a href="xic:color"><b>Color
    Selection</b></a> panel, loaded with that layer's color.

    <li><b>Shift</b>-button 3 will set the current layer to the
    clicked-on layer, and bring up the <a href="xic:fill"><b>Fill
    Pattern Editor</b></a> loaded with that layers pattern.

    <li><b>Ctrl-Shift</b>-button 3 will set the current layer to the

    <p>
    <img src="screenshots/lpal.png" align=right>
    The <b>lpal</b> button in the <a href="topbuttons">top button
    menu</a> will bring up the layer palette.  The layer palette is an
    adjunct to the <a href="layertab">layer table</a> which provides a
    means for quick access to a few "important" layers, and prints
    information about layers.  This is particularly useful when
    working with technologies containing a large number of layers, to
    avoid hunting through the layer table.  When the mouse pointer
    hovers over a layer indicator in the layer table or in the
    palette, information about that layer is printed in the top part
    of the palette.

    The layer palette consists of three logical sections.  The top
    section is a text area that displays information about the layer
    currently or was last under the mouse pointer.  The user can move
    the pointer over the layer icons in the layer table or the
    palette, and the palette will display the information.  The
    information printed includes the <a
    href="techfile:layers">alias</a> and description of the layer, and
    the GDSII mapping layer/datatype numbers.

    <p>
    In the lower section, there are four rows of locations for layer
    indicators.  The indicators in this section can be dragged and
    clicked on in the same manner and same functionality as layers in
    the layer table.  The top row contains layer indicators for the
    last five choices of current layer.  This row is automatically
    updated whenever the user selects a current layer by any means. 

    <p>
    The three rows below can be filled by the user, by
    dragging/dropping layers from the layer table, or from the top row
    in the palette.  Layers in these rows can be dragged/dropped
    within the rows to change the listing order.  A layer indicator
    can be removed from these rows by pressing the <b>Remove</b>
    button at the top of the panel, then clicking on a layer indicator
    in this area.  The indicator will disappear, and the <b>Remove</b>
    button will become unselected.

    <p>
    In order to conserve space, only the index number of the layer in
    the layer table is shown with the layer sample box in the layer
    palette.  The layer's name and other information can be obtained
    by hovering over the indicator with the mouse pointer.

    <p>
    The palette layers can be saved in one of seven registers and
    restored later, with the <b>Save</b> and <b>Restore</b> buttons. 
    There are separate registers for physical and electrical modes, so
    that the same register number can be used in each mode.  The
    current palette is saved when the palette is dismissed, and
    restored when the palette is popped up again.

    <p>
    These registers are saved in a technology file created with the <a
    href="xic:updat"><b>Save Tech</b></a> button in the <b>Attributes
    Menu</b>.  The corresponding technology file <a
    href="PhysLayerPalette">keywords</a> are
    <tt>PhysLayerPalette1</tt> - <tt>PhysLayerPalette7</tt> and
    <tt>ElecLayerPalette1</tt> - <tt>ElecLayerPalette7</tt>.  Each
    keyword can be set to a space-separated list of layer names,
    representing the content and order of the layers in the register.

    <p>
    The <b>selcp</b> button in the <a href="topbuttons">top button
    menu</a> displays the <b>Selection Control Panel</b> which
    provides a number of mode switches which control object selection.

    <p>
    There are three "radio button" groups.  The <b>Pointer Mode</b>
    group sets the mode for selections initiated with <a
    href="button1">button 1</a> while outside of commands.  There are
    three choices:
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><td><b>Normal</b></td><td>Standard select/modify behavior</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>Select</b></td><td>Allow selections only</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>Modify</b></td><td>Allow move/copy/stretch on selected
     objects only</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
    The <b>Area Mode</b> group provides three modes for <a
    href="xic:area">area</a> (drag-over) selections.
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><td><b>Normal</b></td><td>Standard area selection behavior,
      objects are chosen if the object touches but does not completely
      cover the selection area</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>Enclosed</b></td><td>Chosen objects must exist completely
      within the selection area</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>All</b></td><td>Any object that touches the selection
      box is chosen</td></tr>
    </table>
  
    <p>
    The <b>Selections</b> group modifies how chosen objects are
    processed.
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><td><b>Normal</b></td><td>Standard behavior</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>Toggle</b></td><td>Reverse the selected/deselected status
      of all chosen objects</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>Add</b></td><td>Select all unselected objects chosen</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>Remove</b></td><td>Deselect all selected objects chosen</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
    While selecting, and the <b>Selections</b> group is <b>Normal</b>,
    during completion of the selection operation, the modifier keys
    are recognized:
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><td><b>Shift</b></td><td>Select all unselected objects chosen</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>Ctrl</b></td><td>Deselect all selected objects chosen</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>Shift-Ctrl</b></td><td>Reverse the selected/deselected
     status of all objects chosen</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
    Thus, the <b>Toggle</b>/<b>Add</b>/<b>Remove</b> modes can be
    established transiently with the modifier keys.  For area
    selection, the normal operation is to toggle the selections.  For
    a point select (mouse click), if more than one underlying object
    is selected, one of the selected objects is deselected, and there
    is no new selection.

    <p>
    The <b>Objects</b> group specifies the type of objects that can be
    selected and deselected with mouse operations.  The buttons are
    labeled <b>Cells</b>, <b>Boxes</b>, <b>Polys</b>, <b>Wires</b>,
    and <b>Labels</b>.  These buttons control whether or not the
    indicated type of object can be selected or deselected with the
    mouse.  This is useful, for example, when one needs to select
    cells that are covered by geometric objects, since the geometric
    objects will always be selected with a mouse click, and not the
    cells.

    <a name="searchup"></a>
    <p>
    Normally, when scanning through the database for objects that are
    within the selection area, layers are searched from logical top to
    bottom.  The logical top layer is the last layer listed in the
    layer table (i.e., at the bottom).  Thus, in some modes objects on
    upper layers will be selected preferentially over objects on lower
    layers.  If the <b>Search Up</b> button is active, this ordering
    is reversed, layers are searched from logical bottom to top, or
    top to bottom as listed in the layer table.

    <p>
    In the extraction system, the search order will affect the default
    association of terminals to layers.  It also applies to the
    operations in the <a href="xic:exsel"><b>Path Selection
    Control</b></a> panel.

Drag and Drop
!!HTML
    <i>Xic</i> supports standard drag and drop protocols.  One is able
    to drag files from many file manager programs into the main window
    of <i>Xic</i>, and that file will be loaded into <i>Xic</i>.  The
    <a href="filesel"><b>File Selection</b></a> panel from the <b>File
    Select</b> button in the <b>File Menu</b>, and the <a
    href="xic:files"><b>Files Listing</b></a> pop-up from the <b>Files
    List</b> button in the <b>File Menu</b>, participate in the
    protocols as sources and receivers.  The <a href="texteditor">text
    editor</a> and <a href="mailclient">mail</a> pop-ups are drop
    receivers.  While in text editing mode, the <a
    href="promptline">prompt line</a> is a drop receiver, and drops in
    the main window are redirected to the prompt line when editing
    mode is active.  Most of the pop-ups in <i>Xic</i> which solicit a
    text string are also drop receivers.

    <p>
    The file must be a standard file on the same machine.  If it is
    from a tar file, or on a different machine, first drag it to the
    desktop or to a directory, then into <i>Xic</i>.  The Gnome gmc
    file manager allows one to view the contents of tar files, etc. 
    as a "virtual file system".  Window Maker and Enlightenment window
    managers, at least, are drag/drop aware.

    <p>
    Most of the listing pop-ups in <i>Xic</i> are drag sources, i.e.,
    one can drag the name from the listing and drop it in a drawing
    window.

    <p>
    When a window is displaying cells from a Cell Hierarchy Digest
    (CHD), meaning that the <b>Display</b> button in the <a
    href="xic:hier"><b>Cell Hierarchy Digests</b></a> panel is
    engaged, the dropped cell name must match a cell name in the CHD. 
    If not, an error message will appear.  Otherwise, the display will
    switch to the dropped cell as the root.  Changing the display root
    does <i>not</i> change the <a href="xic:chdconfig">default cell</a>
    of the CHD.  In this mode, nothing new is brought into program
    memory.

    <p>
    In normal display mode, the window will open the cell or file
    dropped.  The dropped object can be of various types, depending on
    the source:  file names, cell names from memory, cell names from a
    CHD, and library references are all possible.  If the dropped
    object does not suggest an unambiguous cell, a pop-up will appear
    requesting that the user make a selection from a given listing. 
    This may happen, for example, when a dropped file name contains
    more than one top-level cell, or the dropped name is a library
    containing multiple references.

    <p>
    A dropped file name will cause the file to be read into memory,
    and the top-level cell will be displayed.  A cell name from a CHD
    will cause the cell and its hierarchy to be extracted from the
    CHD's source and loaded into memory, and the given cell will be
    displayed.  Library references that point to a cell will likewise
    be brought into memory, and the referenced cell will be displayed. 
    A cell name will simply display that cell, which if not already in
    memory, will be opened through the library and search path
    mechanism, or created internally as an empty cell if unresolved.

    <p>
    If dropped into the main drawing window, the displayed cell

Status Display
!!HTML
    The status area is located below the <a href="promptline">prompt
    line</a>.  This area provides information about current program
    modes.  It displays the technology name from the technology file,
    if any, the current cell name, the <a href="xic:grid">grid</a>
    spacing, the snap number if not 1, the number of objects selected
    if any, and the level of subedit in a <a
    href="xic:push"><b>Push</b></a>, if in a subedit.  Also displayed
    is a mode keyword, or "<tt>MAIN</tt>", and a code representing the
    <a href="xic:xform">current transform</a> if set.  If the current
    cell has been modified and not saved to disk, "<tt>Mod</tt>" will
    appear in the status area in colored text.  If the current cell
    has the IMMUTABLE <a href="xic:cells#flags">flag</a> set,
    "<tt>RO</tt>" (for "read only") will appear.  If the physical grid
    origin is not 0,0 (set with the <a
    href="PhysGridOrigin"><b>PhysGridOrigin</b></a> variable),
    "<tt>PhGridOffs</tt>" will be displayed in colored text.

Encryption Accessories
!!HTML
    The <i>Xic</i> distribution provides the following utilities for
    encryption/decryption of files.  Although the primary purpose is
    to support the <a href="scr:crypt">encryption</a> of <i>Xic</i>
    scripts, their utility is general.

    <p>
    The utilities are:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>wrencode</tt> <i>file</i> [<i>files</i> ...]<br>
    <tt>wrdecode</tt> <i>file</i> [<i>files</i> ...]
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Both programs take as arguments lists of files to encode or
    decode.  At least one file must be specified.

    <p>
    The <tt>wrencode</tt> program will prompt the user for a password,
    and for a repetition of the password.  The files on the command
    line will be encrypted using this password.

    <p>
    The <tt>wrdecode</tt> program will prompt once for a password, and
    will decrypt the files listed in the command line which have been
    encrypted with this password.  They are not touched otherwise.

    <p>
    <b>WARNING</b>:  since the encryption is done in-place, be sure to
    save a non-encrypted backup of the files, in case the password is
    lost.

    <p>
    The encryption/decryption should be portable between all systems
    that can run these two utilities.

Default Password Setting Utility
!!HTML
    This utility is for use with <i>Xic</i>, and will alter the
    program binary executable to include a user-specified default
    password.  The default password is used for reading
    <a href="scr:crypt">encrypted</a> scripts.

    <p>
    Usage:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>wrsetpass</tt> <i>path_to_executable</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    This utility will reset the default password in the <i>Xic</i>
    binary file image whose path is given as an argument.  The program
    will prompt for a new password, then modify the <i>Xic</i> program
    file.  Note that you must have write permission for the <i>Xic</i>
    executable (which likely means that you must be root).

    <p>
    Note that for security the actual password is not saved in the
    <i>Xic</i> executable file, only an encrypted version.
