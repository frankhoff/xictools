    <p>
    <b><i>Mozy</i></b> is a multi-purpose HTML viewer derived from the
    help system used in the <i>XicTools</i> products from Whiteley
    Research Inc.  These products are described on the Whiteley
    Research web site at <a
    href="http://www.wrcad.com">www.wrcad.com</a>.

    <p>
    When started from the command line, <b><i>Mozy</i></b> will take
    the first argument as a topic to view.  Topics can also be entered
    by using the <b>Open</b> menu item in the <b>File</b> menu.  A
    topic can be one of:

    <ul>
    <li>The keyword associated with a help topic in the help database.
    <p>
    <li>A general URL referencing a page on the world-wide web.  The
    URL must include the protocol specifier ("<tt>http:</tt>") in the
    web address.
    <p>
    <li>The path to a viewable file on the local machine.  A viewable
    file can be plain or HTML text, or an image.
    </ul>

    <p>
    More information on the help system provided by <b><i>Mozy</i></b>
    can be found <a href="helpsys">here</a>, or from the <b>Help</b>
    menu in the menubar.

    <p>
    <b><i>Mozy</i></b> displays level 3.2 HTML, and does not
    understand style sheets and consequently does a poor job displaying
    most current web sites.  It works fine for basic HTML as likely
    found in help text, and in HTML email.

    <p>
    One application for <b><i>Mozy</i></b> is as an accessory to allow
    display of HTML messages from an email client such as
    <tt>mutt</tt> which does not have that capability.  If, from
    <tt>mutt</tt>, HTML content is piped to <b><i>Mozy</i></b>, the
    viewer will appear displaying the content.  Once visible, the
    operation can be repeated and the viewer will display the new
    content.

    <p>
    <b><i>Mozy</b></i> contains some unique features, provided in the
    menus.  One such feature is the optional FIFO created in the
    user's home directory.  Text written to this "file" will be parsed
    and displayed.  Another example is the <b>Log Transactions</b>
    button, which will cause the actual transmissions to and from the
    server to be duplicated to the standard output.  This can be
    useful for debugging purposes.  The <b>Bad HTML Warnings</b>
    button will issue warnings about imperfections in the HTML as it
    is parsed.

    <p>
    <b><i>Mozy</i></b> maintains a cache of pages and images, which is
    located in the subdirectory "<tt>.wr_cache</tt>" in the user's
    home directory.  If you see a really nifty web page, and you want
    to see the source, simply look at the <tt>.wr_cache/directory</tt>
    file.  This will provide a listing of all of the components of the
    page, which are conveniently located in the same directory.  The
    cache contents can also be viewed as a pop-up list from the
    <b>Show Cache</b> button in the <b>Options</b> menu.  Clicking on
    an entry in the list will show that entry.  Thus, you can revisit
    pages even when off-line.

    <p>
    Many of the features and capabilities of <b><i>Mozy</i></b> can be
    configured with a <tt>.mozyrc</tt> file placed in the user's home
    directory.  This is accomplished by pressing the <b>Save
    Config</b> button in the <b>Options</b> menu.  Once this file is
    installed, it will be updated when viewer windows are closed,
    retaining the last settings.

    <p>
    Your comments about <b><i>Mozy</i></b>, and bug reports, would be
    most welcome.  These can be sent to <a
    href="mailto:mozy@wrcad.com">mozy@wrcad.com</a>.

    <p>
    Have fun!

    <h2><i>Mozy</i> Configuration</h2>

    <p>
    When <b><i>Mozy</i></b> starts, it will build an internal table of
    the topics found in the <a href="helpfiles"><tt>.hlp</tt>
    files</a> that are found in the search path.  The search path is a
    colon-separated list of directory paths, and if not given it will
    default to the single directory that corresponds to the default
    installation location for help files.  This is
    <tt>/usr/local/share/mozy</tt>.

    <p>
    The search path is specified to <b><i>Mozy</i></b> through the
    <b>MOZY_HELP_PATH</b> environment variable.  For example, suppose
    that the user has created some new <tt>.hlp</tt> files, and wishes
    to make them accessible to <b><i>Mozy</i></b>, while keeping
    access the the supplied files that are installed in the usual
    place.  The user has placed the files, along with any needed image
    files, in <tt>/home/joe/helpfiles</tt>.  If using
    <tt>bash</tt> or another Bourne-type shell, the command to set the
    environment variable would be
    <br><br>
    <tt>export
    MOZY_HELP_PATH=/home/joe/helpfiles:/usr/local/share/mozy</tt>
    <br><br>
    If using the C-shell, the corresponding command would be
    <br><br>
    <tt>setenv MOZY_HELP_PATH
    /home/joe/helpfiles:/usr/local/share/mozy</tt>

    <p>
    With this variable set in the environment, <b><i>Mozy</i></b> will
    be able to locate and display the user's topics.

    <p>
    When <b><i>Mozy</i></b> starts without an argument, a default
    topic is shown.  The user may prefer that another topic be shown
    instead.  This can be specified with the <b>MOZY_DEF_TOPIC</b>
    environment variable.  This variable can be set to any keyword,
    URL, or local file path that could be given to <b><i>Mozy</i></b>
    through the <b>Open</b> command in the <b>File</b> menu.  When the
    variable is set, the indicated page will be displayed when
    <b><i>Mozy</i></b> first appears.

    <p>
    The environment variables can be set in the user's shell startup
    script to make the definitions "permanent".
