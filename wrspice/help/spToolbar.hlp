Graphical Interface

    When the <b>DISPLAY</b> variable is found in the <a
    href="environment">environment</a> upon program startup,
    <i>WRspice</i> assumes that a graphical (X-window) server is
    available, and will enable its graphical components.  If this
    initialization fails, <i>WRspice</i> will terminate.  If the
    <b>DISPLAY</b> variable is not set, and the <a
    href="-d"><tt>-d</tt></a> option is not used to specify the
    display, or the <a href="-dnone"><tt>-dnone</tt></a> command line
    option is given, then <i>WRspice</i> will run in text-only mode. 
    In this mode, the core functionality is available, but not the
    graphical niceties such as plotting (other than the infamous crude
    line-printer plots of yore).  Under Microsoft Windows, graphics is
    (of course) always available.

    When a graphical interface is available, <i>WRspice</i> by default
    provides a small <b>Tool Control</b> window which provides menus
    for controlling <i>WRspice</i>, and a display containing a
    tabulation of memory statistics.  The menus contain buttons which
    bring up graphical screens, from which much most of <i>WRspice</i>
    can be controlled in a (perhaps) more user-friendly fashion.  The
    locations of the pop-ups and their active/inactive status at
    program startup can be preset by the user.

    <p>
    When running <i>WRspice</i> through the <i>Xic</i> program, by
    default the tool control window will appear when connection to
    <i>WRspice</i> has been established.  The <i>Xic</i> variable
    <b>NoSpiceTools</b> can be set, before the connection is
    established, to prevent the tool control window from appearing.

    <p>
    The text area lists the following quantities, though some may not
    be listed if the operating system does not provide this
    information.  The listing is updated every few seconds.  The first
    line of text shows the current running status of <i>WRspice</i>: 
    idle, running, or stopped.  Also shown on this line is the elapsed
    wall-clock time from the last status change.  The time format is
    hours:minutes:seconds.  The seconds entry has two decimal places
    (resolution is .01 second).  The hours field is not included if
    zero.  The <b>user</b> and <b>system</b> lines are similar, but
    display the total user cpu time used by the process, and the total
    system cpu time, respectively.  The user time generally includes
    input/output processing time, where the system time is pure cpu
    usage.  The <b>data size</b> entry displays the total allocated
    memory in Kb used by the program.  This is only the memory
    allocated by the program for data, and does not include additional
    memory overhead reported by programs such as <tt>top</tt> and
    <tt>ps</tt>.  This size is limited to the <b>program limit</b>,
    which is given in the following line.  This limit can be changed
    with the <a href="maxdata"><tt>maxdata</tt></a> variable.  The
    final <b>system limit</b> line displays the maximum memory
    available from the system for the process.

    <a name="dragdrop"></a>
    <h3>Drag and Drop</h3>

    <i>WRspice</i> supports the xdnd and Motif drag and drop
    protocols.  One is able to drag files from many file manager
    programs into the <b>Tool Control</b> window of <i>WRspice</i> or
    the main window of <i>Xic</i>, and that file will be loaded into
    the program.  The <a href="filemgr">File Selection</a> and <a
    href="filespanel">Files Listing</a> pop-ups participate in the
    protocols as sources and receivers.  The <a href="xeditor">text
    editor</a> and <a href="mailclient">mail</a> popups are drag
    receivers.

    <p>
    The file must be a standard file on the same machine.  If it is
    from a tar file, or on a different machine, first drag it to the
    desktop or to a directory, then into <i>WRspice</i>.  (Note:  The
    Gnome gmc file manager allows one to view the contents of tar
    files, etc.  as a "virtual file system".  Window Maker and
    Enlightenment window managers, at least, are drag/drop aware.)

    <a name="wrbtn"></a>
    <h3>WR Button</h3>

    In the upper left of the <b>Tool Control</b> window is the <b>WR
    button</b>, which contains the Whiteley Research corporate logo. 
    Pressing this button brings up a <a href="mailclient">mail
    client</a>, pre-loaded with the address of the Whiteley
    Research support staff.  The text field containing the address, as
    well as the subject, can be changed.  This can be used to send
    questions and bug reports to Whiteley Research, or to send
    messages or data files to colleagues.

    <a name="runstop"></a>
    <h3>Run/Stop Buttons</h3>

    To the right of the <b>WR</b> button are the <b>Run</b> (green
    arrow) and <b>Stop</b> (red X) buttons.  Pressing the <b>Run</b>
    button is equivalent to giving the <a href="run"><tt>run</tt></a>
    command on the command line, without arguments.  Pressing the
    <b>Stop</b> button issues an interrupt signal that will pause a
    simulation in progress, the same as if the user typed
    <b>Ctrl-C</b> in the console window.

    To the right of the buttons is a menu bar with four entries: 
    <b>File</b>, <b>Edit</b>, <b>Tools</b>, and <b>Help</b>.  Pressing
    the mouse button 1 on these entries brings up a drop-down menu
    containing various commands.

    <a name="filemenu"></a>
    <h3>File Menu</h3>

    The <b>File</b> menu contains commands for manipulating disk
    files.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>File Select</b>
    <dd>Bring up a <a href="filemgr">file manager</a> panel.  This
    panel allows files and directories to be created, deleted, and
    renamed, or read into <i>WRspice</i>.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Source</b>
    <dd>This button creates a dialog, soliciting a file to input into
    <i>WRspice</i>, as with the <a href="source"><b>source</b></a>
    command.  When the dialog is active, the <b>Tool Control</b> text
    window is active as a <a href="dragdrop">drag receiver</a>, so
    that file names can be dragged and dropped from compatible windows
    (such as the file manager), and the file name will be loaded into
    the dialog.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Load</b>
    <dd>This button is similar in operation to the <b>Source</b>
    button, however the file is expected to be a <a
    href="rawfilefmt">rawfile</a> which is the native plot-file
    format, or a Common Simulation Data Format (CSDF) file.  Like the
    <b>Source</b> dialog, the <b>Load</b> dialog supports drag and
    drop protocols through the text area of the <b>Tool Control</b>
    window.  The file is read and data are made available for
    analysis, similar to the <a href="load"><b>load</b></a> command.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Update Tools</b>
    <dd>The <b>Update Tools</b> button will save the current tool
    configuration, and the next time <i>WRspice</i> is started, the
    same tools will be available, in the same locations on-screen. 
    The tools are available in the <b>Tools</b> menu to be described.

    <p>
    Initialization of the graphical interface can be directed from the
    system <a href="startup_files">init file</a> <tt>wrspiceinit</tt>
    found in the startup directory, or more appropriately from the
    user's startup files (<tt>.wrspiceinit</tt> files) as found in the
    current or user's home directory.  Only the file in the home
    directory can be automatically updated from within <i>WRspice</i>. 
    A special command <a href="tbsetup"><b>tbsetup</b></a>, which is
    only recognized in these files, performs the initialization.  The
    <b>tbsetup</b> function takes a long, messy command line, however
    fortunately the user has an easy way to automatically add this
    line, using the <b>Update Tools</b> command.  This action is
    also available from the command line <a
    href="tbupdate"><b>tbupdate</b></a> command.

    <p>
    The <b>Update Tools</b> and <b>tbupdate</b> commands will create or
    update a <tt>.wrspiceinit</tt> file in the user's home
    directory.  If the home directory can't be determined, the current
    directory will be used.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Update WRspice</b>
    <dd>Pressing this button is equivalent to giving the <a
    href="wrupdate"><b>wrupdate</b></a> command, and is equivalent to
    giving the special keyword "<tt>:xt_pkgs</tt>" to the help system,
    which brings up the <i>XicTools</i> <a href="update">package
    management</a> page.  The page lists installed and available
    packages for each of the <i>XicTools</i> programs for the current
    operating system, and provides buttons to download and install the
    packages.

    <p>  
    Unlike in earlier <i>WRspice</i> releases, there is no provision
    for automatic checking for updates, so this command or equivalent
    should be run periodically to check for updated packages.  The
    computer must have http access to the internet for successful use
    of this functionality.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Quit</b>
    <dd>The <b>Quit</b> button will terminate the <i>WRspice</i>
    session, after confirmation if there is unsaved work.  This can
    also be accomplished with the <tt>quit</tt> or <tt>exit</tt>
    command line functions.
    </dl>

    <a name="editmenu"></a>
    <h3>Edit Menu</h3>

    The <b>Edit</b> menu contains commands used to modify input files.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Text Editor</b>
    <dd>This button brings up a <a href="xeditor">text editor</a>,
    similar to the <tt>edit</tt> command.  The default text editor is
    <a href="xeditor">xeditor</a>, but the user can specify a
    different editor with the <b>EDITOR</b> or <b>SPICE_EDITOR</b> <a
    href="environment">environment</a> variables, or with the <a
    href="editor"><tt>editor</tt></a> variable.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Xic</b>
    <dd>This button launches the <i>Xic</i> program, if it is
    available.
    </dl>

    <p>
    For schematic capture, the <i>Xic</i> program must be installed. 
    When either editor is started, the currently loaded circuit, if
    any, and if it has graphical information in the case of
    <i>Xic</i>, is loaded into the editor.  The simulation process can
    be initiated and controlled through <i>Xic</i>.  The internal text
    editor has a <b>Source</b> button, which allows the modified
    circuit to be passed directly back to <i>WRspice</i> for
    simulation.  If another editor is used, changes will have to be
    saved to disk and sourced from <i>WRspice</i>.

    <a name="toolsmenu"></a>
    <h3>Tools Menu</h3>

    The <b>Tools</b> menu contains a configurable collection of
    command buttons which initiate pop-ups which control or display
    various aspects or <i>WRspice</i>.  Each of these pop-ups is a
    graphical short cut to a collection of command line commands. 
    Many users prefer the point-and-click interface to the command
    line, though some do not.  With <i>WRspice</i>, the user has a
    choice.  The command functions available in the <b>Tools</b> menu
    are listed below, in the order found in the menu.

    Clicking on a word in the listing will bring up the help viewer
    with a description of that variable.

    <p>
    The panel is organized into multiple pages, with each page
    containing the variables in a particular category.  These will be
    listed below.

    <p>
    Each variable has its own "box" in the panel.  This box contains a
    <b>Set</b> button, and optionally a <b>Def</b> button and a text
    input area.  The text input area can take several forms, depending
    on the type of variable:  string, integer, or real.  Boolean
    variables have only the <b>Set</b> button.  Text can be entered
    into the area, or in some cases the up/down arrows to the right of
    the text area can be clicked to adjust the text.

    <p>
    When the <b>Set</b> button is active, the variable is set to the
    value shown in the text area (if any), and the text area is
    frozen, i.e., can't be edited.  The text area can be changed only
    with the <b>Set</b> button inactive, in which case the value in
    the text area is arbitrary.  The value is only known to
    <i>WRspice</i> when the <b>Set</b> button is active, in which case
    the variable should appear in the listing brought up by the
    <b>Variables</b> button in the <b>Tools</b> menu in the <b>Tool
    Control</b> window.

    <p>
    The <b>Def</b> button will enter the default value for the
    variable into the text area.  This button becomes active if the
    text area is modified.
