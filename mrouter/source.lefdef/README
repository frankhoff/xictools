README mrouter-1.2.4 12/31/2020

This directory contains the source distributions for the LEF and DEF
toolkits, and documentation, as obtained from the Si2 organization. 
These are redistributed here under the terms of the covering
Apache-2.0 license.

We provide the original LEF and DEF tarballs in ".Z" files, plus
locally updated versions in the corresponding ".gz" files.  The latter
are used in Mrouter.

The two patch files track the differences, with one important
exception.  The file lef/lef/crypt.cpp originally comes with DOS line
termination.  It is important to change this to unix termination
before doing a diff, as the patch will fail under MSYS2 (as of Dec
2020).  It is ok under Linux.  The patches are no longer used in the
Makefile, but are retained.

The most important change in the local version of LEF/DEF is to
compile files with -fPIC, so that they can be used in a shared
library.  There are other tweaks, such as support for Apple OS X and
syntax updates for Bison-3.  Finally, the very numerous compiler
warnings with our standard warning options and gcc-10.2 were fixed. 
Most of the fixes have no real effect, however a few, such as
mismatched print formats and arguments, could indicate bugs.
